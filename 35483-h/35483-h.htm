<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>A basis of fact underlies many of the incidents
incorporated in this story. Even the letters are
very like those received by one of the official agents
of the United States Treasury. Occasional use
has been made of the work entitled, &ldquo;Defrauding
the Government.&rdquo; Out of his material the writer
has tried to present a tale that should be stirring
and yet wholesome, having plenty of action, but
free from sensationalism.</p>
<p>Naturally, changes in characters and localities
have been freely made. If his young readers shall
be interested in the story and shall draw the conclusion
that any attempt to defraud the Government
reacts in harsher form upon the one who tried
to evade the laws, a part at least of his purpose
will have been accomplished.</p>

<h2><span class="large">THE GO AHEAD BOYS ON
<br />SMUGGLERS&rsquo; ISLAND</span></h2>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">AN EARLY MORNING PARTY</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw such a morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never did either. I am glad I am
alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I. It is worth something to be up here
where the air is so strong that you can almost bite
it off. When we left Mackinac this morning one
could hardly tell whether the island was upside
down or not. He could see the reflections just as
clearly in the water as he could see the island
above.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what would happen if a fire should
break out on the island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably it would burn, just as it does everywhere
else. They did have a fire over there once
and they say the whole island burned down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the place for the simple life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is a good place for the simple life, but
to my mind there is a great difference between a
simple life and an idiotic life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>It was an hour before sunrise in a morning in
July. The conversation which has been recorded
occurred on board a beautiful little motor-boat
named the <i>Gadabout</i>. Assisting the captain and
owner in the management of the fleet little craft
was a young man, whose name sounded to the boys
very much like Eph, when they heard the owner of
the boat address him.</p>
<p>On board the motor-boat were four boys among
whom conversation did not lag. The one who had
perhaps the most to say was Fred Button. He
was a tiny, little fellow, though his round face and
rounder body gave him the appearance, as one of
his friends described it, of a young bantam. He
was familiarly known among his companions
sometimes by the nick-name of Stub, or more often
was called Peewee, or Pygmy, the last appellation
sometimes being affectionately shortened into
pyggie, or even pyg.</p>
<p>Seated next to him was John Clemens, a boy already
six feet three inches tall, though he had not
yet attained his eighteenth birthday. Familiarly
he was known as String and frequently, when he
and Fred Button, who were warm friends, were together
they were referred to as the &ldquo;long and
short of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>On the opposite seat was Grant Jones, a clear
headed, self-contained boy of the same age as his
companions. A leader in his class in school and
active on the athletic field, he had won for himself
the nickname of Socrates, which frequently
was shortened to Soc. The fourth member of the
group was George Washington Sanders, a boy
whose good-nature and witty remarks had made
him a favorite among his friends. In honor of
the name which he bore he sometimes had been referred
to as the father of his country, which distinction
was occasionally shortened to Papa, or
even to Pop.</p>
<p>The owner and captain of the swift little craft
was an elderly man, whose whiskers and hair
formed an unbroken circle about his tanned face.
Both he and Eph, when occasion required, served
as oarsmen in the two skiffs which the swift <i>Gadabout</i>
was towing. The light little boats were far
astern, each being held in its place by a long rope
made fast to the <i>Gadabout</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; said Fred Button, rising and stretching
himself, &ldquo;I hope we&rsquo;ll get some fish to-day.
How far do we have to go?&rdquo; he added, addressing
the captain as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It depends a little upon where you want to go
to,&rdquo; drawled the captain in response, without turning
his head as he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was understood,&rdquo; continued Fred,
&ldquo;that we were going to the channel between Drummond
Island and Cockburn Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll have to show your papers, if you fish over
on the Canadian side,&rdquo; growled the captain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t fish on the Canadian side,&rdquo; spoke
up Grant Jones. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave it to you to keep
us in American waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; added John. &ldquo;If we get caught
on the Canadian side, Captain, we&rsquo;ll hold you responsible
for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; growled the captain, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll see what
we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the sun had risen and like a huge ball
of fire was casting its beams across the smooth
waters of Lake Huron. Scarcely a ripple was to
be seen as the boat sped forward. The day promised
to be unusually warm, but as yet the air was
cool, and the spirits of the boys, after their early
breakfast, were all high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get some of these fish to-day,&rdquo;
broke in George Sanders. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t get many
the other day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t far enough away from Mackinac,&rdquo;
said Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve usually noticed,&rdquo; suggested Grant, &ldquo;that
the best fishing grounds are always a good ways
away from where you&rsquo;re staying. The further
away they are, the better they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed that too,&rdquo; laughed George. &ldquo;In
fact there are a good many funny things in this
world. I wonder what people speak of a family
jar for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; inquired Fred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I mean just what I say. I heard a family jar
this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; persisted Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there was a family having a jar in the
room next to mine. Only I think it was a little
more than a family jar, it was more of a family
churn, it was such a big one. There seemed to be
such a very decided difference of opinion that the
jar wouldn&rsquo;t hold all that they were saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t listen to such things,&rdquo; said
Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Listen&rsquo;! &lsquo;Listen&rsquo;! Why that was the very
thing I was trying not to do, but I guess anybody
on Mackinac Island could have heard them, if he
had stopped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who were the people?&rdquo; inquired George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know their names. The man is the
one that wears that ice-cream suit when he goes
fishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I know him,&rdquo; laughed Grant. &ldquo;I
have observed several times that the immaculateness
of his manipulators has not been extremely
noticeable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; laughed John. &ldquo;There seems
to be a superincrustation of unnecessary geological
deposits that doubtless are due to his transcontinental
pedestrianism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, did he have to tramp across the continent
to get here?&rdquo; laughed George.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so. I know more about them than I
wish I did, but I don&rsquo;t know enough to know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I noticed,&rdquo; said Fred, &ldquo;yesterday afternoon
when he came in that his lips looked like Alkali
Pete&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the matter with Alkali Pete&rsquo;s lips?&rdquo;
demanded George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were seldom closed and there were great
crevasses in them, cracked by the alkali.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am taking your word for it,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;but
I confess I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.
I&rsquo;m a good deal more interested in the fish we&rsquo;re
going to get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;re going to get.&rsquo; I like that. Does
String really think he is going to catch any fish?&rdquo;
said George, turning to his companions as he
spoke. &ldquo;His attenuated form doesn&rsquo;t look to me
as if it would be able to stand the strain of landing
the fish some of us are going to catch to-day.
About the only thing I think String will ever catch
will be a crab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;String, how old are you?&rdquo; demanded Grant abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m eighteen in October.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will you be ten?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand your language,&rdquo; replied
John. &ldquo;In your superlunary efforts to appear intellectual
you sometimes state things that are incomprehensible,
even to people of my limited intellectual
parts.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, quit!&rdquo; broke in Fred, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t spoil the day
and scare the fish away. I want to tell you about
Professor Jackson. You know him, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Grant, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s the man who came
on Monday, isn&rsquo;t he? The man who is making investigations
of the island, digging up all sorts of
relics?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man,&rdquo; acknowledged Fred. &ldquo;Yesterday
he dug up some cannon balls. He said
they were relics of the French and Indian war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were all right,&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;I know,
for one of the guides told me that they were the
same balls that had been dug up by every old fellow
for the last twenty-five years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A new crop?&rdquo; laughed Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all. They are the same old cannon
balls. They plant them every spring and give
pleasure to some of these old fellows, who are
traveling around the island in their gentle, antiquated
gait looking for things that belonged to
our grandfathers. They give them the childish
pleasure of making &lsquo;discoveries&rsquo; every year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think they would take the balls away
with them,&rdquo; suggested John.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, they leave them for the historical interest
they provide for the visitors. You go up to the
reception room and you&rsquo;ll find some there now in
the glass case. They are a part of the same crop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; laughed Grant. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an
easy way to keep the old people interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the <i>Gadabout</i> had gained the lower
point of Drummond Island, thirty-five miles from
the place from which they had started more than
two hours before this time. Across the narrow
channel they saw the shores of Cockburn Island.
The latter was within the Canadian boundaries
and as the captain of the <i>Gadabout</i> had explained,
the boys would not be permitted to fish in the
waters along its shore without a special permit
from the Canadian officials.</p>
<p>The shore which they were approaching apparently
had no buildings of any kind. There were
high bluffs and rocky points, but no house was
within sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; called Fred, &ldquo;why are you taking
us to this island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not taking you to this island,&rdquo; responded
the captain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take you past it. I&rsquo;m
not fool enough to try to dodge the Canadian
laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both the captain and his mate were watching
the shore of the island, which every moment was
becoming more distinct.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>Unexpectedly on a bluff far to the left a man was
seen standing and suddenly he appeared to become
aware of the approaching <i>Gadabout</i>. Turning abruptly
about he several times waved a white cloth,
which he held in his hand, to parties that apparently
were behind him. Then, once more facing
the waters, he again waved the cloth. Instantly
and with a grin of satisfaction appearing on his
face the captain changed the course of his motor
boat.</p>
<p>The four boys glanced blankly at one another
and for a brief time no one spoke.</p>
<p>It was later when they learned that the signal
which they had observed was to mean much, both
in excitement and adventure, for all four of the
boys on board the <i>Gadabout</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">THE LANDING ON THE CANADIAN SHORE</span></h2>
<p>As the course of the <i>Gadabout</i> was sharply
changed in response to the call of the captain,
the attention of the four boys was
quickly drawn in another direction. Not one of
them was aware of anything unusual in what
really was a signal on the shore of the Canadian
island.</p>
<p>In a brief time the party was once more in American
waters and as it was still early in the morning,
preparations were soon made for the sport
of the day.</p>
<p>The <i>Gadabout</i> was anchored in a little cove and
the mate, with Fred and John, as the members of
his party, took one of the skiffs, while Grant and
George together with the captain departed in the
other. It was agreed that they should meet at a
certain place for luncheon and the rivalry was keen
as to which boat should have the bigger catch of
fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out for us!&rdquo; called Fred as his boat drew
away from that in which his companions were being
carried. &ldquo;Look out for us! If you hear a
whistle you&rsquo;ll know we will need help.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;To catch your fish?&rdquo; laughed Grant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, to bring them in. We&rsquo;ll have a boat-load,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In high spirits the boys soon were ready for the
sport of the day, and it was not long before neither
boat was within sight of the other.</p>
<p>When the noon hour arrived, still excited and
hungry, the two boats were landed at the place
agreed upon and the captain at once displayed his
skill as a cook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful!&rdquo; said George, not long
after they were seated about the folding table
which the captain had brought in the <i>Gadabout</i>.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful the amount of food a fellow
can put himself outside of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is that,&rdquo; mumbled John, who was as busy
as any of his comrades. &ldquo;It pays for it all, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it pays,&rdquo; laughed Fred. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what we&rsquo;re here for. Honest, Grant, who caught
that big pickerel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; responded Grant proudly. &ldquo;I cannot
tell a lie, I caught it with my little hook and line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask the captain about that later. I saw
some other boats up there where you were and I
am going to ask them how much they charged for
the fish they sold you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t sell us any fish!&rdquo; retorted George
indignantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Another boy that cannot tell a lie. No wonder
they call you the papa of your country. What
do we do this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take you to another place,&rdquo; explained
the captain, who throughout the meal had
been busied in attending to the numerous wants of
the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we get more fish than we did this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; said the captain solemnly.
&ldquo;Some people do and some don&rsquo;t. It mostly depends
on whether they are any good with the rod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we&rsquo;re good?&rdquo; demanded Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; retorted the captain. &ldquo;Maybe you
will be some day. Most of the fish you got this
morning were hooked so that they couldn&rsquo;t have
got off the hook. There&rsquo;s a big difference between
catching a fish that way, and getting one with just
a hook through his lip. It takes some skill then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, captain, just as you say. You show
us the right ground and we&rsquo;ll do the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you will and maybe you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted
the captain as he turned away to prepare
dinner for himself and his mate.</p>
<p>When afternoon came, the <i>Gadabout</i> took the
two skiffs once more in tow and swiftly carried
them seven miles farther, where the wonderful
ground described by the captain was located.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>As soon as the anchor was dropped, the skiffs,
arranged as in the morning, sought the place where
the marvelous fishing was to be had.</p>
<p>Apparently the words of the captain were in a
measure fulfilled for so busy were the four young
fishermen that not one of them was aware of the
increasing distance between the boat in which he
was fishing and the one which carried his comrades.</p>
<p>It was late in the afternoon when Fred suddenly
looked up and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting late, Jack. We
ought to be going back to the boat. I don&rsquo;t see it
anywhere, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the skiff in which Grant and George
are fishing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t see them,&rdquo; said John slowly, after
he had glanced all about him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the
<i>Gadabout</i> either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the mate knows where it is,&rdquo; said Fred
easily. &ldquo;I hope the other fellows won&rsquo;t get into
any trouble, for there&rsquo;s a storm coming up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, Fred pointed to some clouds that
rapidly were approaching in the sky directly overhead.
They were black, angry clouds too, and the
frequent flashes of lightning were followed by reports
of thunder that at first had been so low as
scarcely to be noticed. Now, however, the sounds
were threatening and the oarsman, bidding the
two boys reel in their lines at once, began to row
swiftly toward the point behind which the <i>Gadabout</i>
was anchored.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>In a few moments, however, the calm waters had
become rough. Whitecaps were to be seen all
about them and the boys glanced anxiously at each
other. The wind too had risen now, but instead
of blowing steadily across the waters, it was coming
in puffs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in for it, Jack,&rdquo; said Fred anxiously.</p>
<p>His companion made no reply, though the frequent
glances he cast at the sky indicated that he
too was becoming anxious for their safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want me to help?&rdquo; inquired John
as he glanced at the oarsman.</p>
<p>The mate shook his head in response and it was
plain that he was exerting all his strength in his
efforts to keep the boat headed in the direction
in which it had started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There comes the rain,&rdquo; exclaimed John, as
some heavy drops fell upon them and the nearby
water was becoming more and more disturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take one of these oars,&rdquo; called the mate
sharply, as he spoke rising with difficulty from his
seat and placing one oar in another oarlock.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have all we can do to make the point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time both boys were thoroughly aroused.
The rain was falling in torrents and both were
drenched to their skins.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>Such a plight, however, was hardly to be noticed
in the presence of the danger that now beset
them. In spite of their efforts the wind was driving
them away from the point. More and more the
boys did their utmost but their efforts were in
vain. At last the mate shouted, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing
for it, boys, except to run for it. Sit down and
we&rsquo;ll let the gale drive us across to the other
shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Canadian island was nearby and the shore
could not be more than two miles distant, as both
boys learned from their oarsman. However, it
was with white and set faces that they followed
his directions and each took his seat as he was bidden.</p>
<p>Swiftly the boat was driven before the wind, the
mate exerting himself only to keep the light, little
skiff headed in the right direction. So black were
the clouds that already the boys were surrounded
by darkness almost like that of night. Neither
was able to see the shore toward which they were
headed. The mate, however, appeared to be more
confident than he had been while he was seeking
to drive the boat against the wind.</p>
<p>Swiftly and still more swiftly the frail little
craft sped forward. No one spoke in the brief interval
between the crashes of thunder. The
streaks of the lightning seemed to fall directly into
the waters of the lake and at times the boys believed
themselves to be surrounded by fire. Never
had either been in such peril before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>Fred had sunk into his seat so that only his head
appeared above the gunwale. John, whose seat
was in the stern of the skiff, was so tall that he was
unable to follow the example of his friend and was
clinging tenaciously to the sides of the boat.
Meanwhile, the mate successfully keeping the skiff
headed for the shore, was watchful of every movement
of his passengers.</p>
<p>When ten minutes had elapsed it was manifest
that the anxiety of the oarsman was increasing, as
they drew near the shore. Without explaining his
purpose he did his utmost to change the direction
so that they would move in a course parallel to the
shore, but, labor as he might, he was unable to
accomplish his purpose. Directly upon the rocky
border of Cockburn Island the gale was driving the
little boat.</p>
<p>Once more the mate exerted his strength to his
utmost as he strove to guide the little skiff toward
a cove not far away. For a time it seemed as if his
efforts were to succeed. But at that moment the
wind became even stronger than before and the
howling of the tempest increased.</p>
<p>The boys had a sudden vision of an opening in
the rocky shore, then there was a crash and both
found themselves struggling in the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>When they arose to the surface they saw that
before them the waters were still. The sheltered
cove promised a degree of safety such as a moment
before they had scarcely dared to hope for. Fishing
rods, coats, cooking utensils, tackle, all things
had been thrown into the water when the boat had
struck the jutting rock. All these facts, however,
were ignored in the efforts of both boys to gain
the beach before them, for they now could see a
sandy stretch not more than forty feet in length
that marked the limit of the waters. And it was
only twenty yards away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Fred?&rdquo; called John as he swam near
his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; sputtered Fred. &ldquo;How is it with
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right here. Have you seen the mate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s ahead of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as he spoke the mate could be seen rising
to his feet in the shallower waters and a
moment later he gained the refuge of the sandy
beach.</p>
<p>It was not long before the boys also gained the
same place of safety, although before their arrival
the oarsman had disappeared from sight.</p>
<p>As soon as the boys stood on the shore they
shook themselves much as dogs might do when
they come out of the water and then in a moment
the thought of the peril of their friends came back
to their minds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose has happened to Grant
and George?&rdquo; said Fred in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they must be all right,&rdquo; replied John,
although his expression of confidence was belied by
the tones of his voice. &ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better go up on the bluff. Perhaps there we&rsquo;ll
see the <i>Gadabout</i> or the skiff. They must have
been driven in the same direction that we were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. You see the <i>Gadabout</i> was in
the lee of that point. The last I saw of the skiff it
was on the other side of the point too. I think that
Grant and George probably have gone back to the
<i>Gadabout</i> and are all right. Very likely they are
talking about us at this very minute and are scared
at what may have happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we signal them?&rdquo; inquired Fred anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Signal them? No. We haven&rsquo;t anything to
signal with in the first place and they can&rsquo;t see us
in the second.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The storm is going down,&rdquo; suggested Fred.
&ldquo;They say the lake up here gets quiet almost as
quickly as it gets stirred up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t get quiet any too soon to suit me,&rdquo; said
John dryly. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the mate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t see him anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both boys looked carefully along the shore, but
no trace of the missing oarsmen was discovered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>The rain had ceased by this time and the sky was
clearing. Not a sign of the presence of the <i>Gadabout</i>
was to be seen on the waters before them.
The oarsmen had disappeared and each boy for a
moment gazed anxiously at his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look yonder!&rdquo; said John, suddenly pointing
as he spoke to a spot in the direction of the interior
of the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s a house up yonder. Don&rsquo;t you
see it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean a shanty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you call it, but I see smoke
coming out of the chimney. We&rsquo;ll go up there and
get somebody to help us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moved by a common impulse both boys started
in the direction of the strange house. Neither
was aware that they were entering upon an experience
that was to be as mysterious as it was
trying.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">A MYSTERIOUS HOUSE</span></h2>
<p>The sun was shining brightly as the boys
moved across the island in the direction of
the place they were seeking. As they
stopped occasionally to look back over the waters
of the lake, they saw that the waves still were
tipped with white and the waters still were rough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew where the other fellows are,&rdquo;
said Fred, once more stopping to look out over the
waters that now were reflecting the light of the afternoon
sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are all right,&rdquo; said John, confidently.
&ldquo;I told you both the <i>Gadabout</i> and the other skiff
are around the point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you told me so, but that doesn&rsquo;t make it
so,&rdquo; said Fred, still unconvinced by the confident
manner of his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look yonder, will you!&rdquo; said John abruptly as
he pointed toward the house they were seeking.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure there is somebody in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look as if it would hold together
long enough to let any one stay very long inside,&rdquo;
laughed Fred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find out anyway pretty quick who it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a brief time the boys arrived at the rear of the
little house, which was not much more than a
shanty in its appearance. They found that their
surmise that smoke was rising from the chimney
was correct. There could be no doubt that some
one was within the building.</p>
<p>Once more the boys turned and looked anxiously
toward the lake, eager to discover if any trace of
their missing friends could be seen. The waters
already were becoming smoother and the rays of
the sun were almost blinding as they were reflected
by the shining waters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; said Fred in a low voice.
&ldquo;Shall we rap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we&rsquo;ll rap,&rdquo; retorted John. &ldquo;You
talk as if you didn&rsquo;t know what the customs of civilized
countries are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is knocking one of them?&rdquo; inquired Fred demurely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I guess I don&rsquo;t live in the place you
are talking about, for nobody has rapped at our
door at home for the last ten years. Not since we
have put in electric bells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard work to keep up with you,&rdquo; said
John, not strongly impressed by the attempt of his
friend to be facetious. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll knock here anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>Advancing to the kitchen door, John rapped
loudly to proclaim the presence of visitors.</p>
<p>A silence followed the summons and when several
seconds had elapsed John repeated his knocking.
Still no one came to welcome them, and then,
glancing behind him at his friend, John demurely
raised the latch and opened the door.</p>
<p>Fred at once followed and the two boys found
themselves in a low, rude kitchen. The stove was
in one corner and it was plain now that the smoke
they had discovered was rising from it through the
chimney. Upon the stove several cooking utensils
were to be seen, but as yet no person had announced
his presence in the little building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be somebody here,&rdquo; whispered
Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course there is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why doesn&rsquo;t he show up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will be here in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when several minutes passed and still no one
made known his presence, John decided to announce
their arrival in other ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he called, and then as his hail was not
answered he repeated the summons in tones still
louder. &ldquo;Hello! Hello!&rdquo; he shouted again.</p>
<p>While he was speaking both boys were glancing
toward the rude stairway that led from the room to
the small loft. They had surmised that the occupants
of the house might have been caught in the
storm as they themselves had been, and were in the
upper room changing their clothing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Startled by the unexpected sound both boys
turned quickly about and saw standing in the doorway
of the kitchen a man plainly puzzled by their
unexpected appearance.</p>
<p>Neither of the boys ever had seen him before.
He was apparently fifty years of age, strong, and
his face bronzed by sun and wind. There was an
expression in his face, however, that was puzzling
to both boys. He glanced quickly from one to the
other and for a moment the boys suspected that he
was prepared either to leap upon them or precipitately
flee from the spot, they could not decide
which.</p>
<p>The man was well-dressed and it was plain that
he was not an ordinary inhabitant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got caught in the storm,&rdquo; explained John
hastily. &ldquo;We landed down here and then we saw
this little house and we thought perhaps we could
come up here and dry out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody with you?&rdquo; inquired the other man,
still gazing keenly at both his young visitors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody but the mate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mate of what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Gadabout</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you come over from Mackinac Island?&rdquo;
demanded the man quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;We started this morning
about four o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you came over with Captain Hastings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. We got caught in the storm out here
around the point and we couldn&rsquo;t get back to the
<i>Gadabout</i>, so the mate just let our skiff drive before
the wind and the boat was stove in when we
finally landed in that little cove out yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the mate now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know. He went ahead of us and the
first thing we knew he disappeared from sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he on shore here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, we landed, as I told you, in that little
cove and while we were getting ashore we lost the
mate. We don&rsquo;t know where he went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you say there were others with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; explained Fred, &ldquo;there were two
other boys and they went out with the captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to them in the storm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know. We wish we did,&rdquo; said John
soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; broke in Fred. &ldquo;The
<i>Gadabout</i> and the skiff were both beyond the point
when the storm broke and they had no trouble in
keeping to the lee of the point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This fire feels good anyway,&rdquo; said John, whose
long, attenuated frame was trembling with cold, in
spite of the warmth which had followed the shower.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, boys, that I cannot give you a change,&rdquo;
said the man, smiling dryly as he spoke. As he
was a man who weighed at least 190 pounds, while
John&rsquo;s form towered at least six inches higher and
his weight was at least seventy pounds less, the
idea of either wearing the clothing of the other was
so ludicrous that Fred laughed aloud at the suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said John quickly. &ldquo;All we
want is a chance to dry out before the mate gets
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you going to get back to Mackinac?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said John ruefully. &ldquo;We
thought that perhaps the mate could get word to
the <i>Gadabout</i> and the motor-boat would stop for
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can he get word to the <i>Gadabout</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t know anything about this part of the country.
It&rsquo;s the first time we ever were here. We thought
perhaps the captain might know some point where
he could signal. It isn&rsquo;t more than two or three
miles across, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here,&rdquo; responded the man. &ldquo;But you are
cold and I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if you were both
hungry. I&rsquo;ve seen fellows at your age who sometimes
were afflicted in that manner. I&rsquo;ll put some
more wood on the fire and we&rsquo;ll dry you out and
then we&rsquo;ll see what we can do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>Placing his hands together in a peculiar manner
the man whistled through them and in response, in
an incredibly short time, a little Japanese serving
man appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mike,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;see if you can&rsquo;t find
something for these hungry young fellows to eat.
They were caught in the storm and their boat was
wrecked down here in the cove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Japanese laughed loudly at the explanation
and then quickly turning about departed from the
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say his name is?&rdquo; inquired Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We call him Mike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard of a Japanese with that name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t suppose that is his full name.
That&rsquo;s a mouthful and I don&rsquo;t often speak it. He
has been with me for several years and when he
first came some one named him Mikado, that was
shortened to Mik, and of late that&rsquo;s been gradually
changing to Mike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he wasn&rsquo;t born in Ireland?&rdquo; laughed
John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he belongs to the Sunrise Kingdom. He
will have something for you to eat very soon. I
have been coming here for several years now every
summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is your home?&rdquo; inquired John.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hard to say. I was born on the ocean
when my father and mother were coming from
England. My father was French and my mother
was Russian. We lived in the States two years
after I was born and then we went to Bermuda a
year or two and finally we wound up in Brazil.
From Brazil we moved to Sweden and then went to
Constantinople. After my father and mother died
I came to England and then moved to Montreal.
Now, if you can tell me where I belong and what I
am you&rsquo;ll do better than I have been able to do for
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re a first cousin of the Wandering
Jew,&rdquo; laughed Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I am more like the Man Without a
Country,&rdquo; said the man soberly. &ldquo;I have come up
here from Montreal every summer for the last few
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how do you get here?&rdquo; inquired Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come up the Ottawa River from Montreal and
then I leave the river at Mattawa. It is easy going
then from Lake Nippising, across the Georgian
Bay, and from Georgian Bay into Lake Huron
doesn&rsquo;t take very long. Have you ever been there,
boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; inquired Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Georgian Bay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you have missed one of the prettiest spots
in America. I never tire&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man stopped abruptly as the mate of the
<i>Gadabout</i> suddenly appeared in the doorway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>Without waiting for an invitation he at once entered
the room and then to the surprise of the two
boys extended his hand and received from his host
a small package which he quickly thrust into the
pocket of his coat.</p>
<p>The action although simple in itself nevertheless
was surprising to the boys. It was manifest that
the mate already was acquainted with the occupant
of the house and also that he was having relations
with him. Just what these were neither of the
boys understood, but before many days elapsed
they both were keenly excited by the recollection of
the simple exchange which they had just seen in the
kitchen of the old house on the shore of Cockburn
Island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">THE COMING OF THE GADABOUT</span></h2>
<p>It was quickly manifest to the two interested
boys that the mate and their host were well
acquainted with each other. Puzzled as they
were to account for the familiar greeting it was not
long before John whispered to his companion, &ldquo;I
suppose that man has been coming here so many
years that he knows all the men on the lake. That
must be the reason why they know each other so
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Fred, who was
watching the men with an interest which he was
not entirely able to explain even to himself.</p>
<p>The mate was endeavoring to speak in whispers,
but his voice was so penetrating that it carried into
the remote corners of the house, although no one
was able to distinguish the words which he spoke.</p>
<p>By this time the boys were dry once more and as
they prepared to depart, the Japanese servant unexpectedly
returned. In his hands he was carrying
a tray on which there were numerous tempting
viands. Both boys watched the lithe little man as
he speedily cleared the table and then deposited
upon it the plates and food which he had brought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going now,&rdquo; said their host to the
two boys. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just in time for afternoon
tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know that you served anything like
that,&rdquo; laughed Fred. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll both be glad
to stay and accept your invitation, shan&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; he
added as he turned to John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we shall,&rdquo; replied John, with a sigh
which caused the others in the room to smile at his
eagerness.</p>
<p>The movements of the little Japanese speedily
convinced the boys that he had had long experience
in the work he then was doing. Deftly and silently
he attended to all the wants of the guests and not
many minutes had elapsed before, responding to
the influence, both Fred and John were in better
spirits.</p>
<p>Turning to the mate, John said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
think it is time for us to find out what has become
of the other boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry none about them,&rdquo; said the
mate. &ldquo;I guess the cap knows how to take care of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t know where they are,&rdquo; suggested
Fred. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know how we are going to get
back to Mackinac. We&rsquo;re sure they&rsquo;ll be anxious
about us and I know we are about them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry none,&rdquo; retorted the mate.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be coming this way pretty soon. I can
tell the toot of the <i>Gadabout</i> if Gabriel was blowing
the whistle. They&rsquo;ll be here very soon, but I think
by and by it may be a good thing for us to go
down to the shore and watch a little if we don&rsquo;t
hear the whistle calling pretty soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The entire party still was seated about the table.
Relieved by the confidence of the mate in the safety
of their friends and of the <i>Gadabout</i>, both John
and Fred became more intent listeners to the
conversation which was occurring between the
men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Mackinac Island,&rdquo; suggested their host
after a time, turning to the boys, &ldquo;is one of the
most beautiful spots in the world. Ever been
there before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied Fred. &ldquo;This is our first
visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much. There are no two days alike.
We have been up the river, down the shore of Lake
Michigan and to-day we came over here to Drummond
Island to try the fishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pretty nearly had a shipwreck, didn&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; asked the mate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you can call a skiff that was smashed a
shipwreck.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The skiff isn&rsquo;t smashed,&rdquo; drawled the sailor.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s just stove in. We&rsquo;ll have her fixed up in
no time and she&rsquo;ll be as good as ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fond myself of Mackinac Island,&rdquo; continued
the host. &ldquo;I go over there some days and
shut my eyes and try to imagine what it was like
so many years ago when it was first discovered by
the French.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t hold it very long,&rdquo; suggested
John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and we didn&rsquo;t either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor did the British in the War of 1812. They
got it away from us just as they got it away from
the French years ago. But after that war was
ended it came back to us and nobody has been able
to lay hands on it since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stay there all winter?&rdquo; inquired the host,
turning to the mate as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s pretty cold,&rdquo; suggested Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to &lsquo;guess&rsquo; and you don&rsquo;t need
to say &lsquo;pretty.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s just cold. It&rsquo;s so cold that
when you toss an egg up into the air it just freezes
and stays there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t stay there,&rdquo; said John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; declared the mate. &ldquo;I
guess I know what I am talking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the attraction of gravitation would pull
it to the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; roared the mate, &ldquo;but the attraction
of gravitation is frozen too. Yes, I&rsquo;ve
seen with my own eyes eggs staying right up in the
air and the air itself all froze up and the attraction
of gravitation froze too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be a great sight,&rdquo; laughed Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, and you can&rsquo;t see it anywhere except on
Mackinac Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you do with yourself all winter?&rdquo; demanded
John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get ready for summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then when summer comes you work all the
while getting ready for the winter, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; acknowledged the sailor
soberly. &ldquo;It just seems as if all the time nobody
had a chance to live, but he just plans to get ready
for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the conversation continued John became
more and more thoughtful and silent. Several
times he had been startled by sounds which he had
heard in the room directly above that in which they
were assembled. Twice he suspected that some
one had come to the head of the rude little stairway
and was listening to the sounds of conversation below.</p>
<p>On each occasion it had seemed to him that he
had heard the sound of a rustle of a woman&rsquo;s
dress. But of all this he could not be certain and
even if his surmise had been correct he had no
reason to be more suspicious of their host.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>Indeed his suspicions might not have been
aroused had not he intercepted a look which the
man gave his Japanese servant, which caused the
latter quickly to go to the head of the stairway.</p>
<p>John was deeply interested and striving to appear
indifferent watched keenly the face of the
Japanese when the latter returned to the room and
was positive that he saw the little, brown man
shake his head slightly in response to a question in
the eyes of his employer.</p>
<p>Such actions might be entirely natural, and John
tried to assure himself that there was no cause for
his increasing suspicions that something was not
right in the strange house on the shores of Cockburn
Island.</p>
<p>He had no opportunity to explain his suspicions
to Fred, however, for just then the sailor said, &ldquo;It
is time for us to go back and keep a lookout for the
<i>Gadabout</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Acting at once upon his suggestions the two boys
arose from their seats.</p>
<p>Cordially thanking their host for his kindness in
receiving them into his house and providing for
their wants, they soon departed, following the
mate as he led the way to one of the higher bluffs
along the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that man&rsquo;s name yet,&rdquo; said John
to Fred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; acknowledged Fred. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
know who he is, do we? Well, it&rsquo;s as broad as it is
long, for he doesn&rsquo;t know our names either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably we never shall see him again anyway,
so it won&rsquo;t make any difference, but I should like to
know more about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to have been in several parts of the
world, doesn&rsquo;t he, Jack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He surely does. I don&rsquo;t wonder that he can&rsquo;t
tell what nationality he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out on the lake,&rdquo; suggested Fred. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
as calm as a mill pond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; acknowledged John. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so smooth
that if one didn&rsquo;t know, he wouldn&rsquo;t believe it possible
for it to stir up such a gale as we saw there a
couple of hours ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s one comfort,&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;If it
doesn&rsquo;t take very long for a squall to come, it
doesn&rsquo;t take very long for it to go either. So
we&rsquo;re just about as well off as when we started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except our fish,&rdquo; suggested John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re carrying back some fish, though
they don&rsquo;t show. I don&rsquo;t think I ever ate so much
fish in my life as I did this noon. I think the
pickerel will hold a revolutionary congress&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look yonder!&rdquo; interrupted John quickly.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that the <i>Gadabout</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>Fred instantly looked in the direction indicated
by his companion and far away saw the faint outline
of a small boat which plainly was headed in
the direction of the bluff. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said after a
brief silence. &ldquo;I believe that&rsquo;s the <i>Gadabout</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably they are out looking for us. I hope
the boys won&rsquo;t be worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be afraid of Papa Sanders being
worried,&rdquo; laughed Fred. &ldquo;As long as he and
Grant are in some dry place and don&rsquo;t have to
think of any work they won&rsquo;t trouble their heads
about us, you may be sure about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ought to be ashamed of themselves if
they are not,&rdquo; replied John half angrily. &ldquo;But
they certainly are coming this way,&rdquo; he added a
moment later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and they see us, too,&rdquo; said Fred quickly,
as he pointed to the mate, who, in advance of them,
had arrived at the bluff and was waving a signal.</p>
<p>This signal consisted of a large piece of cloth
that had at one time been white, attached to a
long pole. The sailor was waving this back and
forth in such a peculiar manner that the attention
of the boys at once was drawn to his actions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he trying to do?&rdquo; whispered John to
Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trying to signal the <i>Gadabout</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but what&rsquo;s he doing it in that way for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know, Jack. You&rsquo;re always
suspicious of somebody. Probably the captain
doesn&rsquo;t know that he is doing anything out of the
ordinary.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>Whatever the explanation may have been, in a
brief time the <i>Gadabout</i> was seen approaching the
bluff on which the sailor and the two boys now
were standing.</p>
<p>The skiff in which their friends had been seen
was in tow and soon after it was discovered both
Grant and George were seen in the bow of the swift
little motor-boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. That&rsquo;s a relief,&rdquo; said John
when he was convinced that his friends were on
board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably they feel the same way now that
they have seen us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll know about that very soon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">A PERPLEXING LETTER</span></h2>
<p>It was decided to leave behind them the skiff
that had been wrecked and as the boys ran
down to the shore they saw that the beautiful
little boat had been drawn up on the land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That can be fixed all right,&rdquo; said the mate in
response to the question of the boys. &ldquo;The
frame&rsquo;s all good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither of the boys, however, heard his words as
they both climbed into the skiff, which Grant had
rowed ashore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you, fellows?&rdquo; he asked as he
grasped the oars and headed the little boat once
more for the <i>Gadabout</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We went ashore. The mate just let us drive
before the wind. We couldn&rsquo;t do anything
against it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Fred. &ldquo;We stove in the boat
when we tried to land. The waves were a million
feet high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How high?&rdquo; laughed John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they were pretty nearly ten feet anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about as near as you get to things, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; remarked John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you mean as long as you&rsquo;re
both safe. The captain was afraid you might capsize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean he was afraid we would be capsized,&rdquo;
retorted Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be that was it. At all events he was
afraid you would go into the water and he knew
you couldn&rsquo;t take care of yourselves if you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; exclaimed John abruptly. &ldquo;Here
comes our recent host. I wonder what he wants
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke John pointed toward the shore from
which the man in whose house they recently found
refuge was seen approaching in a skiff. Just
where his boat had been kept was not plain to
either of the boys. There was no boathouse on the
shore and few places where the craft might have
been sheltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he has forgotten something,&rdquo; laughed
Fred, &ldquo;or he&rsquo;s after us. John, did you take anything
from the table when you left the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing except what I had already taken inside,&rdquo;
retorted John.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>In response to the call of the man the departing
<i>Gadabout</i> was delayed until he came alongside.
There was a whispered conversation between him
and the captain, which lasted only a few minutes.
What was said could not be heard by the boys,
although John was really trying to discover what
the subject of the conversation was, at the same
time doing his utmost to appear indifferent.</p>
<p>Fred, who understood the peculiarities of his
companion, laughed silently as he saw John&rsquo;s actions
and shook his head warningly.</p>
<p>Quickly, however, the captain turning about
gave the order to start and almost as if it had been
hurled forward by some powerful and unseen
hand the graceful little boat suddenly started
swiftly on its return to Mackinac Island.</p>
<p>The speed of the motor-boat was much greater
than in the morning. Indeed as the time passed
and the graceful little craft darted over the surface
of the water the boys looked at one another in
amazement. The water seemed almost to rise and
be parted by the bow. It rushed past them with
a noise that was loud and almost confusing. Still
the speed of the <i>Gadabout</i> increased. The roaring
of the waters and the occasional call of the captain
were all that could be heard and in a brief time the
boys abandoned all attempts to speak to one another.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>Darkness had fallen when at last they arrived at
their destination. The lights of the many windowed
hotels and of the cottages along the road
were shining in the evening darkness. There was
yet time, however, for the boys to obtain dinner
and in a brief time all four were seated about the
table, which had been assigned them when first
they had arrived.</p>
<p>Fred was the last to enter the dining-room and
as he did so his companions saw that something
had greatly amused or pleased him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, fellows,&rdquo; he said as he seated himself
at the table. &ldquo;See what I have got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drawing from his pocket a letter, which he explained
he had received from the clerk on his way
to the dining-room, he placed the sheet of paper on
the table and began to read,&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">Sir,&mdash;I am one good american Citizen and I will do not
the other Strangers peoples Cheat us My duty Me oblige to
let you know which Cheater the U. S. Secret Contraband the

<br /><span class="t6">respectfully yours truly,</span>
<br /><span class="t12"><span class="sc">American Brother.</span></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of that?&rdquo; demanded John
as he extended his hand and received the letter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think of it,&rdquo; laughed
Fred. &ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too much for me,&rdquo; said Grant. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
believe even papa here knows what it means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was sent to me,&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;At least
the directions are to Mr. F. Button, and that&rsquo;s my
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were still laughing and talking about
the strange epistle which Fred had received when
at last they withdrew from the dining-room and
selected four chairs near together on the broad
piazza.</p>
<p>They had not been seated very long before the
clerk of the hotel approached the group and said
to Fred, &ldquo;I think I gave you a letter which belongs
to some other man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you did,&rdquo; laughed Fred. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think it belongs to me anyway. Is this the letter?&rdquo;
he added, as he held forth the epistle which
had been the cause of so much mirth among the
boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether it is or not,&rdquo; replied the
clerk. &ldquo;All I know is that there is another man
here, whose name is almost like yours. He is Mr.
Ferdinand Button. That letter was directed to
Mr. F. Button. As you had been here longer than
he I thought it was for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;If it was my letter
I would read it to you, but I guess it belongs to
Ferdinand, so you had better take it and give it to
him.&rdquo; Laughingly Fred held out the letter which
the clerk took and at once withdrew from the
place.</p>
<p>It was not long afterward before a stranger approached
the boys who were still seated and said,
&ldquo;One of you, I am afraid had a letter to-night
which belonged to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess we did,&rdquo; said Fred quickly, rising
as he spoke. &ldquo;My name is Fred Button and the
clerk said that this letter was meant for Mr. Ferdinand
Button.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my name,&rdquo; explained the stranger,
&ldquo;and the letter was for me. Did you read it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have to acknowledge that I did,&rdquo; answered
Fred. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t suspect until I had done
that that it really belonged to any one else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somewhat confused by his confession Fred
noted the bearing of the man before him more
carefully.</p>
<p>It was plain to him now that the stranger was
quiet in his manner, gentlemanly in his bearing
and possessed of a quick intelligence that enabled
him to perceive many a thing which his younger
companions might have lost. The stranger was
about thirty-five years of age and his bronzed face
was nearly the color of that of the captain of the
<i>Gadabout</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been here long?&rdquo; inquired John.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I came this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought perhaps you had been on the lake&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been on the lake,&rdquo; interrupted the
stranger. &ldquo;Indeed, I spend much of my time on
the lake. I am sorry you had the misfortune to
receive this letter which apparently was meant for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you so sure it was for you?&rdquo; inquired
Fred laughingly. &ldquo;It was signed &lsquo;American
Brother&rsquo; and was simply addressed &lsquo;Sir.&rsquo;
Perhaps it was meant for me after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the letter is mine,&rdquo; said the man quietly
and as he spoke the four boys were aware that he
intended to retain possession of the perplexing
missive.</p>
<p>That he was able to do so was manifest in the
breadth of his shoulders and the evidences of
strength which were apparent as he turned and
walked away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; whispered Grant. &ldquo;I guess that
man could tell some stories if he wanted to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he will want to,&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;I
know I want to hear them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation turned from the stranger who
had claimed the letter to plans for the following
day and then when two hours had elapsed all four
boys, thoroughly tired by their experiences of the
day, sought their rooms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>The following morning John was surprised
when he first went down to the lobby to discover
there his host of the preceding day.</p>
<p>At first John suspected that the man intended to
ignore him, for he advanced toward him with outstretched
hand to express his surprise at the unexpected
meeting. The stranger, however, turned
abruptly away. Abashed by the action John&rsquo;s
face flushed and he watched the man when he
slowly walked out to the piazza and seated himself
near the entrance.</p>
<p>Turning to the clerk John said, &ldquo;Who is that
man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; replied the clerk. &ldquo;I have
seen him here several times this summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many years have you been coming here?&rdquo;
broke in John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fourteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you never saw this man until this summer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing much. I just wanted to know. I
had an idea somehow that he belonged to this part
of the country and that perhaps he was here every
summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; answered the clerk. &ldquo;This is the
first summer he has shown up on Mackinac Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean it is the first time he has shown up at
your hotel,&rdquo; suggested John.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t mean anything of the kind. I
mean just what I say, that this is the first summer
he has been seen on the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John said no more and turned away. He had
decided that he would go out to the piazza and see
if this mysterious man was still there. Was it
possible that he had been mistaken? Was not this
the man who had received them in his strange
house on Cockburn Island the preceding day? If
any questions concerning the identity of the man
remained in John&rsquo;s mind they were quickly dispelled
when he glanced toward the dock and there
saw the newcomer talking to the captain of the
<i>Gadabout</i>.</p>
<p>At that moment the other three boys approached
the place where John was standing and declaring
that they were hungry demanded that he should at
once go with them to the dining-room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">AN ADDITION TO THE PARTY</span></h2>
<p>While the boys were seated in the dining-room
they found Fred&rsquo;s namesake,
as they now called Mr. Button,
seated near them at a small table. Apparently,
however, he ignored their presence and paid no
attention to what they were saying.</p>
<p>Convinced, that peculiar as the man&rsquo;s actions
were they had nothing to fear from him, the boys
soon gave their undivided attention to their breakfast
and to discussing their plans for the coming
day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is agreed,&rdquo; said Fred, &ldquo;that we are to go
back to Drummond Island, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t get
as early a start this morning but we ought to do as
much as we did yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Grant, &ldquo;that we shan&rsquo;t have any
such storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I hope,&rdquo; joined in John, &ldquo;that we don&rsquo;t
have any more of these mysterious events that took
us over to Canada and made us afraid there is
somebody watching us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a guilty conscience that is afraid,&rdquo;
retorted Fred, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll go to Drummond Island
and the sooner we can get started the better it will
be. We&rsquo;re late as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the boys departed from the dining-room
they stopped together on the piazza to discuss one
or two further details in connection with their proposed
trip.</p>
<p>To their surprise Mr. Ferdinand Button approached
the group and said, &ldquo;Pardon me, but did
I understand you to say that you were going to
Drummond Island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Fred promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I chanced to overhear your remarks while I
was at breakfast and I thought perhaps you might
be willing to give me a lift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to go there?&rdquo; asked John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Near there,&rdquo; said the stranger quietly. &ldquo;I
find there isn&rsquo;t another motor-boat to be had. I
am going to take a skiff and my man and if you can
find a place for us on board your motor-boat I shall
gladly bear my part of the expense and also appreciate
your courtesy very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you can come,&rdquo; said Fred quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not trouble you about coming back. I
may not be ready to come when you are, or I may
want to come before you do. In either event, I
want to pay for my share of the <i>Gadabout</i> for the
day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk about that later,&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;Are
you ready to start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my man is at the dock with his skiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;Go right down there
and we&rsquo;ll all be down in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Captain,&rdquo; said John, when the boys approached
the dock and found their boat already at
hand. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to take a couple more passengers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; growled the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, this man, Mr. Button. He wants us to
take him over to Drummond Island. He doesn&rsquo;t
know whether he will come back again with us or
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My guide says he will ride in the skiff,&rdquo; suggested
Mr. Button.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be necessary, unless he wants to,&rdquo;
said Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way we&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; said Mr. Button
quietly, and at once the five passengers took their
places on board the swift, little <i>Gadabout</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the captain?&rdquo; whispered
Grant in a low voice to Fred as soon as the
motor-boat had put out from the dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at him, that&rsquo;s all. He&rsquo;s grouchy or else
he&rsquo;s afraid. He looks to me as if he wasn&rsquo;t very
enthusiastic over the addition to the list of passengers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make any difference whether he is or
not. We chartered the boat and can do what we
please with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether or not the captain was suspicious of the
newcomer, the boys gave no further attention to
him. In a brief time they were drawn to the newcomer,
whose knowledge of the region and whose
stories of the early days at once appealed strongly
to his young listeners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Button. &ldquo;There have been
some stirring scenes up around Mackinac Island.
To my mind it is one of the most beautiful spots in
the United States, and, standing just as it does
where the lakes join, I do not wonder that the Indians
did not want to give it up and that the French
and English fought over it the way they did.
There&rsquo;s a very interesting story of the defense of
the old fort. It is published I believe, in a little
pamphlet and my advice to you is to get a copy and
read it before you go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do that,&rdquo; said Grant enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we get back,&rdquo; laughed George, &ldquo;Grant&rsquo;s
head is going to be so full of the information that
he has picked up about the lakes and Mackinac Island,
that the rest of us won&rsquo;t have to do any work,
except to keep him quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, Mr. Button,&rdquo; said Fred, &ldquo;did you
find out anything more about that letter?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>To the surprise of the boys the captain appeared
at that moment, glaring angrily at Fred and turning
about several times after he had started back
to his place at the wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a strange letter,&rdquo; said Mr. Button, &ldquo;but
I am accustomed to such things. It is a part of my
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All four boys looked at him questioningly, but he
smiled slightly without satisfying their curiosity
at the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was saying,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;there have
been some very exciting adventures around Mackinac
Island. Perhaps I will tell you something
about them before long. Just now I should like to
have you tell me about your trip yesterday. Did
you have good luck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It depends upon how you look at it,&rdquo; said John
with a laugh. &ldquo;We caught all the fish we wanted
for our luncheon, but we had a terrific thunder
storm out there that drove us ashore in the afternoon.
At least Fred and I were driven ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were wise lads to run before the gale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t charge us with the wisdom,&rdquo;
laughed Fred. &ldquo;It was the mate that had it. We
were lucky enough to have him with us and he took
us ashore over at Cockburn Island. We weren&rsquo;t
so lucky when we landed, though, because our skiff
was all stove in and we had to leave it when we
came away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get away?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the other fellows took the Gadabout and
began to look for us after the storm died out and
then they came ashore for us in their skiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far is it between Drummond Island and
Cockburn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two or three miles. That&rsquo;s about all, isn&rsquo;t it,
Captain?&rdquo; said John turning abruptly about as
the captain&rsquo;s face once more was seen peering
eagerly at the company seated in the stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about it,&rdquo; drawled the captain.
&ldquo;Have you never been there?&rdquo; he added, looking
directly at Mr. Button as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking forward with great pleasure to the
trip,&rdquo; replied Mr. Button, quietly, apparently ignoring
the question that had been asked. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t think we are likely to have another storm,
to-day, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the captain abruptly, as once more
he turned to his work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about Cockburn Island,&rdquo; said Mr.
Button, speaking to the boys. &ldquo;Is it inhabited?
Are there many people living there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see
very much of it. We found a little shanty, or
shack, not far from the shore and when we saw
smoke coming out of the chimney we went up there
thinking that we might dry our clothes, for we were
wet through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find anybody there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the strange part of it,&rdquo; explained
John. &ldquo;The old shanty, that looked almost as if it
would fall to pieces, was pretty well fixed up inside.
There was a man there and he had a Japanese
servant. Indeed, I am sure I saw the man at the
harbor this morning. At least I thought it was
the same man, but he didn&rsquo;t speak to me, so I
couldn&rsquo;t be sure after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conversation ceased for a time and it was not
until they had arrived off the shore of Drummond
Island that Mr. Button said, &ldquo;I think I will leave
you here. I want to thank you again for your
kindness in bringing me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; demanded the captain,
who again approached the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to leave the <i>Gadabout</i> here,&rdquo; explained
Mr. Button.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you going? There&rsquo;s no good fishing
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to trust my guide for that,&rdquo; explained
Mr. Button, pointing as he spoke to the
man in whose skiff he was to depart. This man
was now seated in his little skiff about one hundred
feet astern of the <i>Gadabout</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fetch him up then,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
stop the <i>Gadabout</i> and let you off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>In spite of the captain&rsquo;s manifest effort to appear
at ease it was plain to his young passengers
that he still was angry or alarmed over the presence
of Mr. Ferdinand Button. What the connection
was between the two not one of the boys was
able to conjecture.</p>
<p>Their attention, however, was speedily drawn to
the skiff which Mr. Button now hauled in and as
soon as it was drawn alongside he stepped lightly
on board.</p>
<p>It was impossible for any of the boys to see the
face of the guide, who at the time was bending low
over a box which contained the fishing tackle. It
was only later when John reminded the other boys
of the strange coincidence between the excitement
of the captain and the inability of all to see the face
of the guide in Mr. Button&rsquo;s boat, that they recalled
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any fishing here,&rdquo; again shouted
the captain.</p>
<p>Apparently Mr. Button was not greatly impressed
by the knowledge of the captain, for ignoring
his words, he seated himself in the stern of the
skiff and prepared to begin his trolling.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the <i>Gadabout</i> was belying her name,
as now she was only drifting slowly with the current.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Captain,&rdquo; called Fred at last.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re ready to start.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better start,&rdquo; retorted the commander of the
motor-boat. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no fishing here and I told
that man there wasn&rsquo;t, but he doesn&rsquo;t seem to pay
no attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s his own fault,&rdquo; laughed Grant. &ldquo;Go
on with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still manifestly reluctant the captain at last
started the engine but the <i>Gadabout</i> had not gone
more than a few yards before he again stopped the
boat and said, &ldquo;We might as well try it here as
anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you said the fishing here wasn&rsquo;t any
good,&rdquo; protested Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll do no harm to try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In accordance with the captain&rsquo;s words the <i>Gadabout</i>
was anchored, and as soon as the young fishermen
were separated into two parties as they had
been the preceding day, the two skiffs were soon
prepared for the sport of the morning.</p>
<p>The captain, who now was rowing the boat in
which John and Fred were seated, had rowed one
hundred yards from the <i>Gadabout</i> and the boys
both were trolling. Still the captain watched the
skiff in which Mr. Button had departed as long as
the little boat could be seen. Even the <i>Gadabout</i>
now was soon lost to sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to have a fresh bait,&rdquo; said Fred, who
had been the first to have a strike. He reeled in
his line and swung the hook around for the captain
to bait it. A moment later the captain abruptly
changing his position dropped overboard the box
which contained the leaders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There I&rsquo;ve gone and done it!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Lost
every leader! There is nothing to do, boys, except
to go back to the <i>Gadabout</i> and get some more.
I&rsquo;m sorry, but it won&rsquo;t take long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing else to be done,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;so the
sooner we get back the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one in the little boat spoke while the captain
rowed swiftly back to the motor-boat.</p>
<p>The surprise of the boys was great when they
drew near the little <i>Gadabout</i> to discover that a
skiff had been made fast alongside the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose skiff is that?&rdquo; demanded John abruptly.
&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t leave any boat here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain without replying increased the
speed at which he was rowing and as he drew near
the <i>Gadabout</i> the boys were startled when they
saw peering from the companionway the face of
Mr. Ferdinand Button.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">ONCE MORE ON COCKBURN ISLAND</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that on board the <i>Gadabout</i>?&rdquo;
roared the captain. &ldquo;What are
you doing there, you lubber?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you know who I am,&rdquo; replied the man
on deck, who now the boys were convinced was indeed
the mysterious stranger.</p>
<p>Both boys were startled, as they looked into the
face of the captain, who was now rowing swiftly
toward the little motor-boat. Whether the expression
on his face was one of anger or of fear was not
known by either. The man, however, was keenly
excited and his anxiety to gain his boat became apparent
with every stroke of his oars.</p>
<p>In a brief time he swung the skiff alongside the
<i>Gadabout</i> and without making any effort to board
the boat the captain roared, &ldquo;What are you doing
on board there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came back to get something that I thought
might be here, which I didn&rsquo;t take with me,&rdquo; said
Mr. Button quietly. It was manifest from his appearance
that he was in nowise alarmed by the
noisy questions of the captain of the <i>Gadabout</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, did you find it?&rdquo; demanded the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot say that I have&mdash;as yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that depends on what you&rsquo;re looking
for,&rdquo; said the captain, his voice becoming lower,
although his excitement was still manifest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t suppose there would be any such feeling
over my coming back to your boat. I have
known of other men who neglected to take some
things with them when they left home, to say nothing
about a motor-boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you say you found it?&rdquo; again demanded
the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found something that will do me just as
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the two men stared at each other,
the captain still keenly suspicious or angry, while
the expression on the face of Mr. Button was one
which the boys were not able to understand. To
all appearances he was unruffled by the noisy
queries of the captain, and yet what was behind it
all no one could say.</p>
<p>There was nothing, however, more to be done
and in a brief time Mr. Button stepped into his
skiff in which the man, who was to be his guide, was
still seated. Without any delay the guide picked
up his oars and resumed his rowing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the captain remained standing on the
deck of the <i>Gadabout</i>, glaring at the departing
skiff, although he did not utter any sound until
the man of whom he was suspicious or afraid had
rounded the nearest point.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better get your leaders, captain, because we
want to start,&rdquo; suggested Fred impatient over
the long delay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; grunted the captain. Nevertheless
he disappeared below and in a brief time came back
to the deck with a box in his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the same box you took out this morning,
isn&rsquo;t it, Captain?&rdquo; laughed John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you say?&rdquo; roared the sailor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, isn&rsquo;t that the same box of leaders that
you took out this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;ll have to own up that it is,&rdquo; said the
captain. &ldquo;I had it in my pocket all the while and
I thought I dropped it overboard. We&rsquo;ll make up
for lost time now, so get aboard, both of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the surprise of the young fishermen, however,
the captain did not return to the ground over
which he had been fishing at the time of his unexpected
return to the <i>Gadabout</i>. Instead, he followed
swiftly in the direction in which Mr. Button
had disappeared. Both boys questioned him
sharply concerning the change in their plans, but
the only reply their guide made was to explain
that he thought the fishing was likely to be better
in the direction in which he was going than where
they had been before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>Fred winked slyly at his companion when several
times the captain ceasing his efforts took a
glass and drank of the waters of the lake and then
taking from his pocket a jointed telescope gazed
long and earnestly in the direction in which they
were moving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble, Captain? What are you
looking for?&rdquo; demanded Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to see if that man&rsquo;s got on my
ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see him anywhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. I wish I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he, anyway?&rdquo; inquired John. &ldquo;You
seem to have a pretty wholesome respect for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you say? What&rsquo;s that you say?&rdquo;
demanded the captain sharply, as he glared at
John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what I said,&rdquo; explained John, &ldquo;was that
you seem to be very much impressed by him. Do
you know who he is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo; about him,&rdquo; retorted the
captain, resuming his occupation once more.</p>
<p>When at last the captain declared that they had
arrived at the grounds he was seeking the boys
renewed their attempts of the morning. For some
reason, however, all their efforts were unavailing.
Either the fish were not there, or they were not
biting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe, Captain,&rdquo; said John, at last, &ldquo;that
you were more interested in following that man
than you are in getting a good shoal for us to fish
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you say?&rdquo; retorted the captain.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no such thing. It&rsquo;s no such thing. I don&rsquo;t
care about that man any more than I do about&mdash;you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a strange way of showing it, then,&rdquo;
suggested Fred with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what I&rsquo;ll do, boys,&rdquo; said the captain
at last. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t have any luck here by
noon I&rsquo;ll take you across the channel and we&rsquo;ll try
it &rsquo;long Cockburn Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t any right to fish there. That&rsquo;s
in Canadian waters,&rdquo; said John quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have a permit,&rdquo; explained the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for us, too?&rdquo; inquired Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, good for you, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both boys were somewhat dubious as to the extent
of the permission secured by the captain, but
they made no protest. Swiftly the little boat was
rowed across the intervening waters and in a brief
time, under the shelter of the bluffs of the island
they were seeking, preparations were made for
resuming their sport.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want many fish just now,&rdquo; said the
captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s lucky for us,&rdquo; laughed Fred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What I mean is, that we want something for
dinner, but that&rsquo;s about all. After dinner we&rsquo;ll
see what we can do with our luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the time came for landing, the captain
turned to the boys and said, &ldquo;Before I start a fire
I want to go up to that house yonder for a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; suggested Fred, winking
at John as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the captain sharply. &ldquo;You stay
right here on the shore. If you want to you can
start a fire and have things goin&rsquo; so that when I
come back everything will be ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose is the matter with the
captain?&rdquo; inquired John after the departure of
their guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why he&rsquo;s either afraid of or he doesn&rsquo;t like
that Mr. Button. Maybe he&rsquo;s the man that wrote
that letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More likely he&rsquo;s the man that the other fellow
wrote the letter about,&rdquo; laughed John. &ldquo;I
think myself that the old fellow will bear watching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen anything in him that I thought
was wrong,&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;Naturally he doesn&rsquo;t
waste very much affection on the officials of the
law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why he shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; broke in John.
&ldquo;Unless there&rsquo;s something wrong with him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There may be something wrong as far as the
law is concerned, but I guess the old fellow himself
thinks he&rsquo;s right. You know there are a good
many people that do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose he&rsquo;s up to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe anybody knows, not even the
captain himself. I guess it&rsquo;s his general principles.
He&rsquo;s opposed to everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think this Mr. Button is anything more
than he appears to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; said Fred thoughtfully. &ldquo;It
may be that he knows a good deal more than he explains
and it may be that letter he got, which was
sent to me first, has made him suspicious of the
captain. I don&rsquo;t myself believe there&rsquo;s anything
the matter with the captain anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look yonder!&rdquo; said John quickly, dropping
the fish, which he was cleaning, as he spoke.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that Mr. Button himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hastily looking in the direction indicated by his
friend Fred was silent for a moment and then
said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just who it is. What do you suppose
he&rsquo;s doing here on this island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t on the island yet. I&rsquo;ll tell you later
what he does, that is, if he lands. Don&rsquo;t let him
see us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>Hastily moving behind the high bushes, though
neither boy could explain just why he did so, they
watched their fellow-guest, as his skiff was swiftly
sent ashore and Mr. Button himself stepped out
upon the land.</p>
<p>It was plain that he was not aware of the presence
of the boys and that all his movements were
being keenly watched.</p>
<p>The interest of the boys, however, was speedily
increased and in a brief time both were highly excited
when they saw Mr. Button take from his
pocket a revolver, which he inspected carefully and
after he had returned it to its place he at once
started toward the house in the distance.</p>
<p>It was the same rude, little shanty in which the
boys had found refuge the preceding day. Now,
however the sun was shining brightly and the clear
waters of the lake were reflecting its beams.
There were no signs of life about the house on the
shore, but both boys excitedly watched Mr. Button
as he made his way across the fields and after a
brief time approached the side door of the house
and then entered the little building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go up to the house, too,&rdquo; suggested Fred
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s no reason why we shouldn&rsquo;t go
and if there&rsquo;s any fun going on we want to be on
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you,&rdquo; said John cordially, and as
soon as they had banked their fire both boys
started across the open field toward the house in
the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you,&rdquo; said Fred in a low voice,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s something going on up in that house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You always make a mountain out of a mole
hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps I do, but I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s something
doing and they may need us before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, probably they are wondering now why we
don&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; laughed John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just you wait,&rdquo; retorted Fred. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see
I&rsquo;m right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I thought you were, I know of one fellow
who wouldn&rsquo;t go near that house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re going just the same,&rdquo; said Fred
positively.</p>
<p>There was no delay and after the boys had
crossed the field they approached the kitchen-door
of the rude, little house where Fred made
known their presence by his noisy summons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">LEFT BEHIND</span></h2>
<p>In response to Fred&rsquo;s knock the door was
opened by the little Japanese servant. He
stared blankly at the boys and then broke into
another of his loud laughs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any one here?&rdquo; inquired Fred.</p>
<p>The response of the Japanese was another boisterous
laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell us?&rdquo; demanded John, irritated
by the manner of the little man; but the
sole response of the Japanese was a loud burst of
laughter after each inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go in anyway,&rdquo; suggested Fred.</p>
<p>The Japanese offered no opposition to their entrance
and when they were within the familiar
room they glanced hastily about them, but there
were no signs of the man they were seeking.</p>
<p>Abruptly, however, Fred said, &ldquo;Hush! Listen,
Jack! That&rsquo;s the captain&rsquo;s voice upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both boys were silent as they listened attentively
to the sound of voices which now could be heard
from the upper room. Gradually the captain&rsquo;s
voice became louder and it was manifest that he
was either in trouble or angry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>To the astonishment of the boys the interview
suddenly ended and the captain, rushing down the
stairway, abruptly departed from the house. Apparently
he had been unaware of the presence of
either of the boys. He had glanced neither to
the right nor to the left and as the boys looked
out of the window they saw that he was walking
rapidly toward the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him go,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll have to wait for
us anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I was sure that he would wait,&rdquo; said
Fred doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait? Of course he&rsquo;ll wait,&rdquo; retorted John.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s paid for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure,&rdquo; said Fred once more. &ldquo;I
think the best thing to do would be for one of us to
go back and see that everything is all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; responded John quickly. &ldquo;You
stay here if you want to and I&rsquo;ll go down to the
shore and see if anything happens there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Fred seated himself in the room and
watched the Japanese servant, who apparently
ignored his presence save occasionally when he
stopped and stared blankly at him for a moment
and then broke into a noisy laugh.</p>
<p>Not many minutes had elapsed, however, before
John came running back to the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The captain has taken the skiff and left the
island!&rdquo; he said excitedly when he burst into the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess not,&rdquo; said Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he has, I tell you. He was rowing like
mad. He has taken the skiff and left us here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go down to see about it,&rdquo; said Fred,
abruptly rising and accompanying his friend as
together they ran back to the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is, just as I told you!&rdquo; said John,
when they arrived on the bluff. &ldquo;The boat has
gone and the captain has gone with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Fred made no reply. He glanced
in either direction along the shore, and then peered
intently out over the water, but neither the boat
nor the captain was to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; demanded John.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange and I told you there&rsquo;s something
wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll come back again,&rdquo; said Fred confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you think so,&rdquo; responded John.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure of it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll come out all right,&rdquo; persisted Fred.
&ldquo;Come on now, we&rsquo;ll go up to the house again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the boys returned to the house and once
more entered the kitchen, the little Japanese servant,
who met them at the door, made no protest
when they entered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>Once more the boys seated themselves in chairs
near the window. They occasionally glanced
blankly at each other for there was really no explanation
for their presence in the house. At
the same time they were both watching the waters
of the lake not far away, but their watching was
vain, for when an hour had passed no signs of
the captain had been seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the man that lives here?&rdquo; finally
Fred inquired of the Japanese.</p>
<p>The servant laughed loudly, but shook his head
to imply that he did not understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows English, all right, I&rsquo;m telling you,&rdquo;
said John in a low voice to Fred. &ldquo;This is getting
all mixed up. I wish we were back in Mackinac.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are finding trouble everywhere, Jack,&rdquo;
said Fred, although he too was at pains to speak
in subdued tones. Turning once more to the Japanese
he continued, &ldquo;Can you get us some supper?
We&rsquo;ll pay you for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sole reply of the servant was another of his
unmusical bursts of laughter. Either he did not
understand what was said, or he took this method
of ignoring the requests of his uninvited visitors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back to the shore,&rdquo; suggested John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; responded Fred, and together the
two boys at once departed from the little house.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the shore not only was
their own boat gone, but the boat in which Mr.
Button had come had also disappeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of that?&rdquo; demanded John
in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Fred, genuinely
surprised by the double disappearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;m not Calamity Jane&rsquo;s brother after
all,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more in this than you
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred was silent, though it was plain that he was
puzzled by the failure to discover any of the boats.
The <i>Gadabout</i> also was nowhere within sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing for us to do,&rdquo; said Fred at last, &ldquo;except
to wait. They must know we&rsquo;re here and
there&rsquo;s no way for us to get away unless the <i>Gadabout</i>
comes for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have to wait,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;and
that&rsquo;s all there is to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together the boys remained on the shore until
at last the sun sank below the western horizon.
Darkness would soon be creeping over the land
and both boys now were more serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s plain the boys are gone,&rdquo; said Fred soberly.
&ldquo;I thought surely one of them would be
back here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;The captain was
in such a hurry when he started that I didn&rsquo;t believe
he would come back. I don&rsquo;t half believe we
will ever see him again anyway. I tell you there&rsquo;s
something wrong here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>Fred&rsquo;s expression was serious as without making
any reply he looked out over the waters of the
lake.</p>
<p>The darkness deepened and night would soon
be at hand. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing for it,&rdquo; said Fred
at last, &ldquo;except to go back to the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what good that will do,&rdquo; said
John, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m ready to go if you want to. This
is the strangest thing I have ever been mixed up
in in my life. For my part I wish I was out of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, John,&rdquo; said Fred, striving to speak
cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not crying,&rdquo; retorted John, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t
like the look of the whole thing. I tell you there&rsquo;s
something serious in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred said no more and in a brief time the boys
were standing once more at the kitchen door.</p>
<p>Again the little Japanese, who had the faculty
of apparently being in different places at the same
time, faced them as they entered. This time he
did not greet their coming with his usual loud
laughter, but as he made no protest the boys entered
and Fred said to him, &ldquo;Did you get some
supper for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Either the Japanese did not understand, or he
continued his pretense, for he shook his head,
though his expression was not unfriendly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>Both boys had suspected when they returned
that the Japanese was about to bar their entrance.
Either they were mistaken, or he had changed his
plan for now he busied himself in his duties about
the kitchen, apparently ignoring the presence of
the two uninvited guests.</p>
<p>A few minutes later both boys were startled by
what they were certain was the voice of a woman
calling from the head of the stairway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mikado,&rdquo; called the woman, &ldquo;did you let those
boys in again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether the Japanese understood or not he ran
to the foot of the stairway and a low conversation
between him and the woman who had called
him followed, of which neither Fred nor John was
able to distinguish any word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You better give them some supper,&rdquo; at last
she said in tones that the boys plainly heard.
&ldquo;Tell them to go away then. We haven&rsquo;t any
place for them to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A candle was burning on a little side table in the
kitchen and in its dim light each boy was able to
see the face of his companion. It was plain to
each that the other was now seriously perplexed.
However, a few minutes later, the Japanese entered
the room with a tray on which he had a
simple supper to which by a motion of his head
he invited the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see how dark it is?&rdquo; whispered John
to Fred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Fred as he glanced out of the
window. There were no stars to be seen in the
sky and the wind as it whistled about the corner
of the little building gave forth sounds that were
weird and strange.</p>
<p>The boys seldom spoke throughout the meal and
when at last they arose, one of them took some
money from his pocket and handed it to the Japanese,
who served them.</p>
<p>Quickly the little man took the money and thrust
it into his pocket. No language was required for
the transaction and it was clearly manifest that
he understood the action of his guest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go down to the shore again,&rdquo; suggested
Fred. &ldquo;Perhaps one of the boats has come in and
the fellows are looking for us now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both boys ran swiftly on their return but when
they arrived on the bluff once more they were
doomed to disappointment. Not a boat was to
be seen in the dim light. Nor was any light to be
seen as they looked out over the waters. Somehow
the darkness itself seemed to be startling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any boat here and there isn&rsquo;t any
boat coming,&rdquo; said Fred at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; inquired John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing for us to do,&rdquo; said
Fred, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s to go back to the house. We&rsquo;ll
have to explain to them why we haven&rsquo;t left, and
I don&rsquo;t believe that woman, even if she didn&rsquo;t want
us to see her, will turn us out on a night like this.
We&rsquo;ll tell her that we&rsquo;ll pay for our lodging and
I guess she&rsquo;ll let us in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>Neither boy, however, was confident of his
welcome when they once more retraced their way
and started back toward the little house which
now itself was wrapped in darkness. Not even the
beams of the candle now could be seen shining
through the kitchen windows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">THE LOST SKIFF</span></h2>
<p>Slowly the boys again crossed the familiar
field. In their distraction the various objects
assumed grotesque forms in the dim
light. The swaying branch of a low tree seemed
almost like the extended arm of a waiting man.
Every sound that came from the waters startled
them. The cry of the night birds was unusually
weird and penetrating.</p>
<p>Neither of the boys was willing to acknowledge
that he was afraid, but nevertheless they kept
closely together and did not speak until once more
they were standing before the kitchen door.</p>
<p>Both were startled when not far away they
heard the sound of a deep growl. They had not
seen any dogs about the premises in their previous
visits and both were startled by the unexpected
sound.</p>
<p>In their haste and alarm they both began to rap
upon the door. The dog, still growling, did not
advance upon them, but they could see the dim outline
of his form as he stood near the corner of the
house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>There was no sound within and no response was
given to their summons. Nor when they repeated
their knocking, as they did several times, was any
heed paid them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; whispered Fred, looking
up into the face of his companion. &ldquo;There must
be somebody in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the door,&rdquo; suggested John.</p>
<p>Fred reached for the latch, and, doing his utmost
to be quiet in his action in order to avoid undue
attention on the part of the dog, tried to open the
door.</p>
<p>The door, however, was locked or bolted and
although both boys pushed against it with their
shoulders they were unable to move it. For the
first time they were aware now how massive and
strong the door was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t much like an ordinary kitchen door,&rdquo;
whispered Fred as they abandoned their effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not,&rdquo; responded John. &ldquo;We
can&rsquo;t get in and that&rsquo;s the only thing I can see
plainly around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish George and Grant were here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I, but if wishes were horses, beggars
might ride. Is that dog creeping any nearer to
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that it is. I guess all there is left
for us is to go back to the shore and wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We seem to be left on all sides, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty much, and I hope that dog thinks so
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cautiously withdrawing from the kitchen door
the boys slowly moved toward the corner of the
house. Not far before them was a pile of wood
and in case they should be attacked by the growling
brute, they were hopeful that there they might find
some weapon of defense.</p>
<p>Suddenly both boys found themselves in need.
With another growl the dog advanced upon the
boys as soon as they had passed the corner.</p>
<p>Leaping to the wood-pile John drew forth a stick
three or four feet in length and only about two
inches in diameter. Fred was less fortunate and
unable to secure a weapon he darted toward the
opposite side of the pile.</p>
<p>Meanwhile John was compelled to face the dog.
As the savage animal leaped forward John struck
at it, but either his blow was too slow, or he did not
see plainly in the dim light, for he failed to stop
its progress. He had, however, almost succeeded
in dodging the brute, which fastened its teeth
in his trousers and steadily held John in his
grip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit him! Hit him!&rdquo; said John excitedly.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got me and I can&rsquo;t get away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In response to the appeal of his comrade Fred
hastily took a stick from the wood-pile and advanced
upon their common enemy. The dog, however,
still clung to John in spite of the boy&rsquo;s desperate
attempts to use his club.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>Lifting the stick which he carried Fred brought
it down with all his force upon the back of the
dog, which still was growling and clinging to its
prisoner. There was a loud yelp of pain and
relinquishing its hold the dog fled howling back to
the house.</p>
<p>Without waiting to discover the reception which
awaited the animal, both Fred and John started
swiftly across the field toward the shore.</p>
<p>Frequently they glanced behind them, but it was
manifest that the dog was not pursuing them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a backache,&rdquo; suggested Fred, &ldquo;or
else he&rsquo;s homesick. He doesn&rsquo;t want to leave the
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said John heartily. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t know there was any dog around there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I. I don&rsquo;t know where they kept him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they will only keep him now that&rsquo;s all I
want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing more was said until at last the boys
arrived at the shore. Both looked keenly out over
the waters hoping to discover some trace of their
friends. In the dim light, however, they were
unable to discover the presence of any boat on the
waters or of any parties on the bluff. The night
air was becoming cooler, although the breeze which
had arisen at sunset had now died away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>For several minutes the boys stood waiting and
listening upon the shore and then Fred in a loud
whisper said hastily, &ldquo;Listen, Jack. Do you hear
anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the water?&rdquo; inquired John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both boys listened intently and in a brief time
John said eagerly, &ldquo;I do hear something. To me
it is like the sound of oars in oarlocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s it exactly,&rdquo; said Fred.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a boat out there somewhere, only we
can&rsquo;t see it. Let&rsquo;s get behind these bushes and
wait until it comes nearer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Acting upon Fred&rsquo;s suggestion they quickly took
their places behind a low growth of bushes only a
few feet back from the water. There they were
still able to see what occurred on the lake, and at
the same time in the dim light would not be readily
discovered by any parties that were approaching.</p>
<p>Not many minutes elapsed before the dim outlines
of the skiff were discerned. There was only
one occupant and he was rowing toward the shore,
apparently unconcerned whether or not his presence
was known.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahoy, there!&rdquo; called John abruptly.</p>
<p>The sound of the oars abruptly ceased and a
brief period of tense silence followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s in the skiff?&rdquo; called John.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait until I come ashore and I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo;
came the reply. With a few sturdy strokes the
oarsman sent the light little skiff ashore and as he
stepped out on the ground both boys were startled
when they discovered the newcomer to be Mr. Button.
Why he should be coming from the lake was
something they could not explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the <i>Gadabout</i>?&rdquo; demanded Fred eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you seen anything of the other boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a trace of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose has become of them?&rdquo;
demanded John, who was beginning to be seriously
troubled by the failure of his friends to appear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot say,&rdquo; replied Mr. Button. &ldquo;What
are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we should like to know ourselves,&rdquo;
replied Fred ruefully. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get
into the house and we haven&rsquo;t any boat so it looks
very much as if we would have to stay here on the
shore all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you get into the house?&rdquo; inquired Mr.
Button.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. We have been up there two or three
times. The doors are locked and no one pays any
attention to us when we rap. Besides they have
got a dog there and he&rsquo;s a savage brute. He got
John by the trousers and wouldn&rsquo;t let go until I
hit him on the back with a stick of wood.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Was it John or the dog you hit?&rdquo; inquired Mr.
Button dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dog, of course. What are we going to do
now, Mr. Button?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can get you over to the shore of
Drummond Island, but I should like very much to
have you wait a little while before we start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; replied both boys together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Button, &ldquo;I would
like to have you come with me up the shore as far
as that cove where the mate left his skiff after it
was stove in. It isn&rsquo;t more than one hundred
yards or so from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys readily consented after they had assisted
Mr. Button to haul his boat farther up on
the beach.</p>
<p>Whatever the purpose in the mind of the man
was he did not explain, nor were the boys able to
conjecture what it was after they had walked along
the shore as far as the cove and then had returned
to the spot where the skiff in which Mr. Button
had come had been left.</p>
<p>Their consternation, however, was great when
after a vain search they were convinced that the
skiff was gone. That it could have drifted away
was impossible. All three were alike convinced of
that fact. There was not much wind now and the
little boat had been hauled so far from the water
that it was impossible for it to drift away. There
was only one conclusion and that was that some
one had taken it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>For a moment they stood in silence after they
were convinced that the boat indeed was gone, and
then the boys, keenly excited, turned to their companion
demanding what he would suggest as the
next thing to be done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">THE FLIGHT OF THE GADABOUT</span></h2>
<p>For several minutes the boys ran up and
down the shore vainly searching for the
missing boat. They were convinced that
some one had taken the skiff and probably was
not far away, as it would be impossible for any
one to go far during the short time that had
elapsed since they had left the spot where Mr.
Button had landed.</p>
<p>At last the search was abandoned and when the
boys returned they discovered Mr. Button awaiting
their coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, boys,&rdquo; he said in a low voice. &ldquo;Do
you hear any sound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were silent, but in a brief time Fred
said quickly, &ldquo;Yes, sir, I think I hear a motor-boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are correct,&rdquo; said Mr. Button. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a boat coming this way. I have been sure of it for
two or three minutes, but I have not been able to
make out its outlines, as yet. Can either of you
boys see it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>Neither Fred nor John was able to discern the
outlines of the boat, which steadily sounded
nearer. A few minutes only had passed before
Fred gleefully announced his discovery of the approaching
motor-boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it must be the <i>Gadabout</i>,&rdquo; he said eagerly.
&ldquo;Probably George and Grant are on board
and they are looking for us. Shall I hail them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Mr. Button quickly. &ldquo;At least
not yet. We had better wait here until we are sure
who is on board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obediently the boys followed the instructions
and waited until the motor-boat had come within
twenty feet of the shore. There the power was
shut off and the course slightly reversed, so that
the <i>Gadabout</i>, for it was indeed the missing boat,
came slowly about, broadside to the island.</p>
<p>Although the boat was so near, it was impossible
for John or Fred to see who was steering.
They were aware that at least three were on board
for they saw plainly the forms of the men as they
let go the anchor and the boat became stationary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s George and Grant&mdash;&rdquo; began Fred,
at the same time preparing to advance near the
water. He was sharply recalled, however, by Mr.
Button, who once more urged the boys to remain
behind the bushes where they had taken their
stand until they had seen who made up the party
on the <i>Gadabout</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>Only a brief time elapsed before a man stepped
on board a skiff and pushed out from the motor-boat
to the shore. Without using his oars the
boat soon ground on the beach and when the occupant
stepped forth both of the watching boys were
aware that it was the mate of the <i>Gadabout</i>.</p>
<p>He pulled his skiff up on the shore, and then,
scarcely glancing behind him, at once passed
swiftly into the field and soon disappeared from
sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going up to the house,&rdquo; said Fred in his
excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like it,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;Shall we follow
him?&rdquo; He had turned to Mr. Button as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the man quickly. &ldquo;The thing for
us to do is to take this skiff and board the <i>Gadabout</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said John eagerly. &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we
better hail the other fellows before we do that
though? We are not sure that Grant and George
are on board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, hail them,&rdquo; said Mr. Button, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t
make much noise about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John stepped forth from behind the bushes and
taking his stand on the shore called, &ldquo;Ahoy there!
George, is that you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; came the response from the
motor-boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fred and I are here,&rdquo; responded John.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who are &lsquo;I&rsquo;?&rdquo; laughingly came from some one
on board the <i>Gadabout</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you know who we are. That&rsquo;s you,
isn&rsquo;t it, George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Grant and I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I wanted to know,&rdquo; responded John.
&ldquo;Wait a minute and we&rsquo;ll be with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John and Fred quickly hauled the skiff into the
water but before they had taken their seats Mr.
Button approached and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me behind,
boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t going to stay very long,&rdquo; suggested
Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be all right,&rdquo; said Mr. Button, &ldquo;but
take me with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys delayed a moment while Mr. Button
stepped on board and seated himself in the stern
of the little skiff. A moment later the little boat
was alongside the <i>Gadabout</i> and all three stepped
on board, Fred still holding the painter in his
hand.</p>
<p>Before them sat George and Grant peering eagerly
into their faces and plainly surprised by the
unexpected action of their companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must leave right away,&rdquo; said Mr. Button.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; demanded Fred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t time to explain to you,&rdquo; said Mr.
Button, &ldquo;but the only thing for us to do is to get
away from this island, and the <i>Gadabout</i> is the
best means for us to use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the boat doesn&rsquo;t belong to us,&rdquo; protested
John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; laughed Mr. Button. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
you hire it for the day? Didn&rsquo;t you pay the man
to bring you out to Drummond Island and then
carry you back to Mackinac?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he hasn&rsquo;t done all he agreed to, has he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s no reason in the world why we
shouldn&rsquo;t start out. It must be between nine and
ten o&rsquo;clock at night. We have been cheated out of
a good deal of our day by the captain and we have
a right to take his boat and go on back to Mackinac
if we want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys still hesitated to adopt the unusual
suggestion and after a brief silence, John said,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe any of us knows very much about
running a motor-boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t necessary,&rdquo; said Mr. Button. &ldquo;I
know all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, although he continued his conversation
with the boys, Mr. Button had hauled in the
anchor and then made fast the skiff to the stern.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>Without waiting for any further words he at
once advanced to the wheel and as soon as the
power was turned on the speedy, little craft began
to draw away from the dim shores of Cockburn
Island.</p>
<p>They had not gone far, however, before they
heard a loud hail from the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, there!&rdquo; called some one. &ldquo;What are you
doing with that motor-boat? Come back here!
Come back here with it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A low suggestion from Mr. Button caused all
the boys to remain silent.</p>
<p>Again the hail came from the shore, louder than
before and in tones of one who evidently was angry
or alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back with that boat! You&rsquo;ll run her
aground! I&rsquo;ll have you arrested for piracy!
Bring that boat back here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All four boys were decidedly uneasy over the
situation in which they now found themselves.
They had recognized the voice of the mate as the
one which had ordered them to return with the
boat. They were aware also that the charge he
had made, that they were stealing or running away
with a chartered boat, might become a serious matter
for all concerned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>Almost as if he was aware of the thoughts in the
minds of his companions, Mr. Button said quietly,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, boys. I&rsquo;ll see you out of this
trouble, but just now there&rsquo;s nothing else to be
done. You can put the whole blame on me, for
I&rsquo;m the one that took the <i>Gadabout</i>. I&rsquo;m steering
her and I am taking her against your protests.
You see you cannot help yourselves because we&rsquo;re
too far from the shore now for you to try to get
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment again there came a loud call
from the shore, but it was evident from the tones
of the voice that the <i>Gadabout</i> was rapidly leaving
Cockburn Island behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring back the boat! I&rsquo;ll give you ten dollars
to bring her back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence still followed the noisy offer, however,
and only a few minutes had elapsed before the
<i>Gadabout</i> had passed beyond the sight of any one
who might be standing on the shore.</p>
<p>Apparently Mr. Button was not in any confusion
as to the course he was to follow. Directly across
the narrow waters he steered until in a brief time
the shore of Drummond Island loomed before
them. Then changing his course he guided the
swift, little craft on a line parallel with the shore.
The boat was moving southward and all four of
the unwilling passengers expected that in a brief
time they would pass the point of Drummond
Island and then would turn westward and seek the
harbor at Mackinac.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>The speed of the <i>Gadabout</i> was increasing now
and in the dim light the waters near the stern
seemed almost to glow with light. There was excitement
for the boys in the midst of the mystery,
but all had become silent and watchful of the man
at the wheel.</p>
<p>Swiftly the little <i>Gadabout</i> plowed its way
across the smooth waters. The point of Drummond
Island was passed and then to the amazement
of the boys the course was not changed. The
<i>Gadabout</i> now was headed for the open waters of
Lake Huron. Mackinac Island lay far to their
right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have made a mistake, Mr. Button,&rdquo; called
George anxiously. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t the way back to
Mackinac Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, boys,&rdquo; replied Mr. Button,
without glancing behind him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring you out
all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are headed in the wrong direction,&rdquo;
protested Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; said Mr. Button once more.
&ldquo;I know what I am doing and so will you all pretty
soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was too dark to enable any of the boys to
perceive the expression on the faces of his comrades.
That they all were aghast at the unexpected
turn of events, however, was manifest to all,
but the little <i>Gadabout</i>, as if the anxiety of its
passengers was of no concern, kept steadily on its
way toward the open waters of Lake Huron.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">ALONE ON THE LAKE</span></h2>
<p>The four boys huddled together near the
stern of the swiftly moving motor-boat.
For a few minutes silence rested over the
group. They were aghast at the turn of events
and all were alike fearful of the consequences of
their appropriation of the <i>Gadabout</i>, although no
one acknowledged his fears.</p>
<p>George was the first to break the silence, when,
leaning toward his friends he said in a whisper,
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s veering off to the left now. Do you see
what he&rsquo;s doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we are,&rdquo; replied John after the boys had
carefully looked ahead. &ldquo;That must mean that
we are headed for the Canadian shore somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where we are headed,&rdquo; said
Grant, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;re going to get there pretty soon.
I wish I knew what the trouble is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose Mr. Button is crazy, do
you?&rdquo; suggested Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Grant soberly. &ldquo;Most
of the people that have his name are candidates
for insane asylums.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are safe in making that remark now,&rdquo;
retorted Fred. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t forget it, however.
You wait until we go back to Mackinac&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid if you wait until then,&rdquo; broke in
George, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll forget all about his kind words.
You don&rsquo;t suppose this fellow is really crazy, do
you? He acts like a man beside himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as true as you live,&rdquo; said John in a
whisper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wondering if we ought not to jump
on him all together and take the wheel away from
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say a crazy man is ten times as strong as
a man who isn&rsquo;t crazy,&rdquo; suggested Fred. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t believe we had better attempt that, yet
awhile, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s become of his man?&rdquo; inquired Grant
abruptly. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t on the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; responded the boys all together,
after they had glanced all about the boat, as if
they were expecting to discover the guide whom
Mr. Ferdinand Button had taken with him when
the party had set out from Mackinac Island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re four to one anyway,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not in any hurry yet to try to do anything violent,
but if the worst comes we ought to be able to
handle him. There&rsquo;s a fellow for each foot and
each hand and between us we ought to be able to
take care of him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>Meanwhile the swift little <i>Gadabout</i> was speeding
forward, as if it was governed by a spirit of
its own. The water rushed past the stern, boiling
and singing on its way. The eyes of the boys,
more accustomed now to the dimness of the light,
saw no objects in whichever direction they glanced
over the dark waters. And the speed of the
motor-boat was unchecked.</p>
<p>Still the <i>Gadabout</i> swept forward in its course.
Not once did Mr. Ferdinand Button give any token
to indicate that he was even aware of the presence
of the boys on board the boat. He had not once
glanced behind him and if he was looking steadily
ahead, the boys, who frequently glanced in that
direction, were unable to discover any object toward
which he was guiding his course.</p>
<p>Silence fell upon the little group seated in the
stern of the motor-boat, and the depression which
rested upon all alike seemed to deepen with the
passing moments.</p>
<p>Suddenly the speed of the <i>Gadabout</i> slackened.
A moment later the engine ceased to go and although
the motor-boat was still moving swiftly forward
it was doing so because of the headway under
which it had been speeding.</p>
<p>Instantly every boy leaped to his feet and stared
blankly into the faces of his companions. In spite
of the dimness of the light the alarm which every
one felt was manifest and for a moment there was
silence deep and intense.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; demanded Fred, who was the
first to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give it up,&rdquo; replied John. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something
happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk like a philosopher,&rdquo; said George impatiently.
&ldquo;As if we didn&rsquo;t know that! What&rsquo;s
wrong, Mr. Button?&rdquo; he added in louder tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; replied Mr. Button, who now
turned and joined the boys. &ldquo;I cannot quite make
out whether our gasoline has given out or whether
a blade in our propeller is broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If our gasoline is gone,&rdquo; said Grant, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re
likely to be out here on the lake for some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and if a storm comes up,&rdquo; added Fred,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to have troubles of our own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t begin to borrow troubles,&rdquo; said Mr. Button
in a tone of irritation. &ldquo;They may come, but
it will be time enough to face them when we have
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are we going to do?&rdquo; demanded
Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have one of you boys get into the
skiff with me and I&rsquo;m going to try to find out if
anything is the matter with the blades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find out,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;what the supply
of gasoline is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking his place on board the skiff, which was
in tow, John seized the oars while Mr. Button
seated himself in the bow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>In a brief time the motor-boat was motionless
and then pushing the bow of the skiff against the
stern of the <i>Gadabout</i>, Mr. Button, who had taken
off his coat, rolled back his sleeves and began to
investigate the condition of the blades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said abruptly, &ldquo;it is what I feared.
There&rsquo;s something wrong there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo; inquired John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we can do anything until it is
light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll just drift about over the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose a storm comes up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose it doesn&rsquo;t? There isn&rsquo;t anything
we can do to bring it on or to keep it away. We&rsquo;ll
have to take things as they come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a hard job for the Go Ahead Boys to
hang out here all night. We aren&rsquo;t used to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a good time to learn it,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Button dryly, as pulling himself alongside the
motor-boat he directed his companion to step on
board, an example which he himself followed a
moment later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gasoline is out,&rdquo; said George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Button quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re in a worse plight than I thought
we were,&rdquo; said Mr. Button, &ldquo;for there&rsquo;s something
wrong with the blades.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it won&rsquo;t make any difference whether
the blades are right or wrong, if there&rsquo;s no gasoline
to drive the engine,&rdquo; said Fred disconsolately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cannot do anything but wait,&rdquo; said Mr.
Button. &ldquo;The morning will be here before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so won&rsquo;t breakfast,&rdquo; said Grant dolefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have no trouble,&rdquo; explained Mr. Button,
&ldquo;just as soon as it is light. Somebody will be out
here fishing and we&rsquo;ll get help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t want to wait until morning,&rdquo; protested
Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you really don&rsquo;t want to wait,&rdquo; said Mr.
Button, &ldquo;then the only thing you can do is for two
of you to take the skiff and row ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might get lost,&rdquo; suggested Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so you might,&rdquo; acknowledged Mr. Button.
&ldquo;I was following a suggestion, that&rsquo;s all.
It&rsquo;s the only thing which can be done that occurs
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the suggestion is so bad,&rdquo; said
Fred. &ldquo;We can keep within hailing distance of
the <i>Gadabout</i> and it may be that we shall find
some other boat nearby, or it may be that we are
not very far from the shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know we are not very far from the shore,&rdquo;
declared Mr. Button, &ldquo;but it isn&rsquo;t the shore of the
mainland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; demanded George.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Western Duck Island. I&rsquo;m sure we cannot be
far away from it. Now, if two of you boys want
to take the skiff and make some investigations I
don&rsquo;t think there will be any special danger.
Don&rsquo;t go too far away, though your whistle or
your voices will carry a long distance over the
water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m one of the Go Ahead Boys, and I&rsquo;m for trying
it,&rdquo; said Fred sturdily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m with you,&rdquo; said John.</p>
<p>A moment afterward both boys stepped on board
the skiff and with John at the oars and Fred seated
in the stern, they speedily left the <i>Gadabout</i> behind
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go very far away,&rdquo; called George warningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, we won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; called back John, and
then silence rested over the waters of Lake Huron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had better row in a circle,&rdquo; suggested
Fred. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the captain of this expedition and
I want you to follow my directions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, sir,&rdquo; responded John glibly, &ldquo;but
the main thing is to keep a sharp outlook for a
boat coming or going, or for any light that we may
see on the shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time John rowed forward in silence.
Both boys were keenly observant, but they were
unable to discover any trace of the shore, nor were
any lights of passing vessels seen on the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think we have gone about far enough,&rdquo; suggested
Fred, when a half-hour or more had
elapsed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; answered John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better let me row back,&rdquo; said Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, too,&rdquo; responded John.</p>
<p>The boys exchanged places and Fred rowed
more rapidly on their return than his companion
had done on their advance.</p>
<p>Several minutes elapsed and then John said in
a low voice, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange we don&rsquo;t see anything
of the <i>Gadabout</i>. I thought that we were headed
right for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; answered Fred. &ldquo;We had better
call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John placed his hands about his mouth and
shouted: &ldquo;Ahoy, there! Is this the <i>Gadabout</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He repeated his hail several times, but as no
answering shout was heard, he again hailed the invisible
motor-boat.</p>
<p>Still no response was given to his call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we had better shout together. Two can
make more noise than one,&rdquo; suggested Fred, rising
from his seat as he spoke. &ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; he
added, &ldquo;when I say three, let&rsquo;s yell together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But though the boys united a half-dozen times in
their shouts, the silence of the night was still unbroken
and no signs of the presence of the <i>Gadabout</i>
were seen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">THE SEARCH IN THE NIGHT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;This is becoming pretty serious,&rdquo; said
Fred in a low voice when both he and
John were convinced that they were not
near the missing <i>Gadabout</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You went too far to the right,&rdquo; retorted John.
&ldquo;I thought you were going in the wrong direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why didn&rsquo;t you say so, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had, I would have been told my advice
was good when it was asked for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Jack,&rdquo; said Fred, his friendliness
returning and manifesting itself in the tones of his
voice. &ldquo;Things aren&rsquo;t so bad, and they might be
a good deal worse. I guess the <i>Gadabout</i> is off
yonder,&rdquo; he added, pointing to the East as he
spoke. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll row a while in that direction and
we&rsquo;ll try it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seating himself at the oars Fred pulled in the
direction he had suggested. When several minutes
had elapsed, once more he ceased rowing and
both boys united in a hail. Still there was no response
made to their calls and the spirits of the
boys drooped accordingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you this is getting serious,&rdquo; said Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you afraid?&rdquo; demanded John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some, and I don&rsquo;t mind saying so. We never
ought to have left the <i>Gadabout</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may all be true,&rdquo; responded John, &ldquo;but
we did leave the <i>Gadabout</i> and we are here on the
lake. The only thing for us to do is to go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Fred more cheerfully.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t forgotten our name, but I&rsquo;m wondering
whether we really are going ahead or
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we may be rowing around in a circle,
the way a man travels when he is lost in a woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it is not quite as bad as that,&rdquo; responded
John. &ldquo;Want me to take the oars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said Fred sturdily, once more seating
himself and resuming his task.</p>
<p>A half-dozen times the boys rowed ahead and
then stopping, united in a call to their friends.</p>
<p>Their call, however, was unanswered and at last
both boys were convinced that they had lost the
location of the motor-boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t anything for us to do except to
wait until morning,&rdquo; said Fred at last.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is, too,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;You let me
take those oars. I&rsquo;m not going to stay here. I&rsquo;m
sure we&rsquo;ll find the <i>Gadabout</i> or something just as
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t trouble me as much as somebody
finding us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, suppose some boat runs us down in the
dark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can hear a boat two miles away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we are awake,&rdquo; suggested Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be awake all right, at least I shall, for
I&rsquo;m going to keep rowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t be my plan,&rdquo; said Fred, nevertheless
relinquishing his position to his friend.
&ldquo;I think we are just as well off to wait where
we are and when the sun rises we&rsquo;ll know better
what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not much for waiting,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to see if I can&rsquo;t find that boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several times John ceased rowing and the boys
united in calls and shouts and finally joined in a
shrill whistle.</p>
<p>Their efforts, however, were still unavailing and
the conviction steadily deepened in their minds
that they were lost on Lake Huron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we stay where we are,&rdquo; suggested Fred at
last, &ldquo;we can get back to Mackinac Island in the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In which direction do you think Mackinac
Island is?&rdquo; demanded John.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s off yonder,&rdquo; said Fred, pointing to his
right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re dead wrong, Fred. It&rsquo;s right off
here,&rdquo; affirmed John, pointing as he spoke in the
direction opposite to that which Fred had selected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to go around the world,&rdquo; declared
Fred, &ldquo;before you get to Mackinac Island, if you
follow the direction you suggest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we will, but I have got these oars and
I&rsquo;m going to try it,&rdquo; declared John.</p>
<p>Fred laughed derisively and did not make any
offer to relieve his friend.</p>
<p>John, however, apparently was determined to
follow his plan and for a long time rowed steadily
forward.</p>
<p>At last Fred broke in upon the silence, saying,
&ldquo;I tell you, John, you&rsquo;re simply taking us farther
away from Mackinac Island all the time. Can&rsquo;t
you see that you are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see much of anything,&rdquo; replied John,
disconsolately. &ldquo;I guess maybe I am wrong after
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;re wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; retorted
John. &ldquo;If we go in the direction you suggest
we may be as far as ever from the <i>Gadabout</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Fred confidently. &ldquo;You let
me take those oars and you&rsquo;ll soon see for yourself
that I am right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>The exchange of places was made, but after Fred
had rowed for an hour or more his confidence also
began to wane. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not as sure as I was,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m just sure of one thing,&rdquo; responded
John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we are lost and that neither one of
us knows where he is. And what&rsquo;s more,&rdquo; he
added, &ldquo;the only thing for us to do is to stay
right where we are and wait until the sun
rises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long will that be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any idea. I haven&rsquo;t any matches
and I can&rsquo;t see the face of my watch. If I can
judge by my feelings it ought to be about the week
after next. It seems to me we have been out here
forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred did not respond, however, and for a time
the boat drifted on in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that ahead?&rdquo; demanded John, abruptly
pointing as he spoke toward the bow.</p>
<p>Instantly both boys were peering eagerly in the
direction indicated by John, and, after a brief
silence, Fred said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s land ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I think,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;What do
you suppose it is? Do you think it is Mackinac
Island?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;More likely it is Paris, France,&rdquo; retorted Fred
scornfully. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose we&rsquo;re anywhere
near Mackinac Island, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I know I wish we were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I, but we&rsquo;re not. Now what shall we
do? Shall we go ashore, or shall we keep out here
on the lake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had better go ashore,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;At
least we can row in near enough to see what it&rsquo;s
like, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred required no urging as he renewed his
labors and not many minutes had passed before
both boys were convinced that they were steadily
drawing nearer to land. Whether it was the mainland
or an island they were unable to determine at
the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all marsh along here,&rdquo; declared John at
last when the boat was not many yards distant
from the shore. &ldquo;I can see the rushes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Jack,&rdquo; acknowledged Fred a moment
later after he too had peered intently at the
nearby shore. &ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, keep on, and we&rsquo;ll watch for lights too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t see any lights this time of night,&rdquo;
retorted Fred. &ldquo;If there is anybody willing to
live in this forlorn spot he&rsquo;s probably in bed four
or five hours ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, go ahead anyway,&rdquo; said John.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>Accordingly Fred again grasped the oars and
slowly rowed forward. For a long distance they
were unable to discern anything but the marsh on
their right. There was no place seen where they
might make a landing nor was an attempt considered
worth while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any use in this,&rdquo; said Fred at last.
&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t getting anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try a little longer,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll
come to something different. There you have it!&rdquo;
he added a few minutes later when apparently they
came to the end of the marsh and saw before them
the dim outlines of a sloping bank. &ldquo;We can land
here, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land!&rdquo; retorted Fred. &ldquo;What do you want
to land for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, maybe we can find a house or some place
where we can get some gasoline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gasoline will be a fine thing for us,&rdquo; laughed
Fred, his courage having returned with the knowledge
that they were no longer on the open waters
of the lake. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better take the oars, Jack,
and we&rsquo;ll row on a little further. Even if we can
see no light perhaps we can find a house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the boys exchanged places and John
rowed slowly along the shore.</p>
<p>Neither of the boys discovered any house, however,
nor did they see any indications that the
region was inhabited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re having a fine time here,&rdquo; Fred said at
last. &ldquo;There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anybody living
here. We haven&rsquo;t anything to eat and we haven&rsquo;t
even a gun or a fishing-rod in our skiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t need any of them,&rdquo; said John,
&ldquo;when the sun rises. We&rsquo;ll be sure to find somebody
who will take us back to Mackinac Island, or
maybe the <i>Gadabout</i> will be looking for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My namesake acted as if he liked to spend a
good deal of time searching for us,&rdquo; said Fred
scornfully. &ldquo;I tell you, Jack, he has other business
on hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can take him back to the insane
asylum and claim the reward,&rdquo; suggested John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or to state prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, or he may be something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make any difference what I mean.
I have my own ideas and I&rsquo;m not going to cast any
pearls before swine. What I&rsquo;m going to do now
is to go ashore. The sun will be up in a half an
hour. It&rsquo;s beginning to be light in the east now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, John,&rdquo; acknowledged Fred.
&ldquo;It surely is getting light over yonder. I don&rsquo;t
know what you&rsquo;re going to gain by landing, but
I&rsquo;m willing to try it, if you want to. Be careful
that you don&rsquo;t strike a rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly had Fred spoken before there was a dull
thud and a moment later it was evident that the
frail little skiff had struck the jagged point of a
hidden rock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">A FRESH ARRIVAL</span></h2>
<p>Water at once began to pour into the
skiff but the boys were so near the
land that neither was greatly alarmed.
By a few vigorous strokes the little boat was
quickly sent ashore. Leaping out upon the dry
land both Fred and John seized the gunwale and
together brought the skiff far up from the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty kettle of fish,&rdquo; said Fred.
&ldquo;Just look at it! There is a big leak. You must
have stove a hole in the bottom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn it over and let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; suggested John.</p>
<p>In a moment the boat was overturned and the
fears of the boys were confirmed when they discovered
that the blow against the jagged rock, although
it had not torn a hole in the bottom of the
skiff, had nevertheless sprung it in such a manner
that it was leaking badly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are we ever going to get back to Mackinac
Island?&rdquo; said Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we won&rsquo;t have to go in this boat,&rdquo; answered
John. &ldquo;Just now, the thing for us to do
is to look around here and find out whether we are
really Robinson Crusoes or there are some people
living here who can give us some breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Fred, more cheerfully
at the mention of the possibility of a morning meal.
&ldquo;You run up the shore in one direction and I will
go down the other way. We&rsquo;ll come back in about
five or ten minutes and we&rsquo;ll report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred&rsquo;s suggestion was agreed to by his friend
and the boys at once started along the banks which
were only a few yards back from the shore.</p>
<p>More than the allotted time had passed when the
two boys returned. Neither had been able to discover
any tokens of the presence of people dwelling
or camping on the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks pretty dark,&rdquo; said Fred more disconsolately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to go back,&rdquo; said John solemnly, &ldquo;but
it takes some nerve and grit to go ahead. I never
yet knew a boat that drifted up the stream. If
you leave it alone and don&rsquo;t do anything it will
go down stream every time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak like a philosopher, as I told you,&rdquo;
said Fred. &ldquo;I wonder sometimes how one small
head can carry all you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s not original either, I have heard
that before. What&rsquo;s that yonder?&rdquo; he suddenly
added.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>At the question both boys turned and looked out
over the waters of the lake. In the distance a tiny
speck could be seen, but it was plainly moving
toward the place where they were standing. The
sun had risen by this time and the quiet waters of
the lake were flooded with its beams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a a motor-boat,&rdquo; declared John after a brief
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right once in your life, Jack,&rdquo; acknowledged
Fred. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what it is and it&rsquo;s coming
straight toward the place where we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you had all your crying for nothing. It
doesn&rsquo;t pay to give up when there&rsquo;s still any
chance to go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait and see. Perhaps we&rsquo;ll know more
an hour from now than we do just at this minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eagerly the boys watched the coming of the
motor-boat. It steadily became more distinct and
not many minutes had elapsed before both boys
were convinced that the little boat was nearly of
the size of the <i>Gadabout</i>. Then they were able to
distinguish two men on board, one at the wheel
and one seated in the stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought at first it might be the <i>Gadabout</i>,&rdquo;
said Fred in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; joined in John. &ldquo;I can see now
that it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So can I. What do you suppose it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the remotest idea. If we wait long
enough we&rsquo;ll find out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose that boat is coming here
for?&rdquo; inquired Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s another thing you&rsquo;ll have to wait to
find out. You&rsquo;re a great lad. You make me think
of what the headmaster said the other day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; inquired Fred. &ldquo;He often
makes remarks to you that I don&rsquo;t hear, and some
of them I am very glad I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, too,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;What he
told us the other day was that children and savages
are the people that are the most likely to give
way to their feelings. They laugh and cry when
strong people keep quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; demanded Fred
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean anything. I&rsquo;m just telling you
what the headmaster said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are going to land right in here,&rdquo; said
Fred abruptly, as the motor-boat slightly changed
its course and apparently was approaching the
very place where the boys had made their unfortunate
landing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go farther back,&rdquo; suggested John.
&ldquo;Maybe it is some more of this strange business.
It won&rsquo;t do any harm if they don&rsquo;t see us and I
don&rsquo;t believe they have yet because they wouldn&rsquo;t
be looking for anybody where we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come ahead,&rdquo; suggested Fred, quickly acting
upon the advice of his companion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>Drawing farther back and yet still remaining in
a position from which they were able to see the
approaching boat, the boys were confident that
they would not be seen. Both excitedly were
watching the coming boat.</p>
<p>In a brief time the power was shut off and the
anchor was cast overboard. Then in a small skiff,
which the motor-boat had in tow, the man who had
been at the wheel quickly rowed toward the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see who that is?&rdquo; whispered Fred in
great excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; replied John quickly. &ldquo;It is that man
that we saw on Cockburn Island. It is the same
one that came over to Mackinac. What do you
suppose he&rsquo;s coming here for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know just as much about it as I do. If we
keep still we may be able to learn more in a little
while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The excitement of the watching boys did not decrease
when they saw the man, who now they were
convinced was indeed their recent reluctant host
on Cockburn Island, step quickly ashore and then
draw his boat up on the beach.</p>
<p>Apparently the presence of the other skiff had
not yet been noted. Indeed, the boys were quite
confident it had not been discovered, as the place
where they had landed was around a little bend in
a small cove.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>The actions of the man, however, soon became
more mysterious and puzzling. Out of his pocket
he took a small package and seating himself upon a
rock he proceeded to open it.</p>
<p>There were occasional flashes of light that were
reflected in the eyes of the boys, although neither
were able to discover the contents.</p>
<p>After carefully refolding the package the man
restored it to his pocket and then advancing
toward the higher bank stopped for a moment
there and peered intently all about him.</p>
<p>Apparently satisfied that he was unobserved the
mysterious stranger then advanced rapidly toward
some woods in the distance. He had, however,
gone only a part of the intervening distance when
another man was seen approaching from the midst
of the trees and in a brief time the two men met.</p>
<p>There was a hasty consultation which greatly
interested the boys, although they were unable to
discover its purpose. They were convinced, however,
or at least Fred was positive, that there had
been an exchange of packages made by the two
men and then instead of returning to the shore
the man whom they had been watching advanced
beside the stranger and soon both were lost to
sight within the borders of the woods.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the motor-boat had been left in
charge of the man who had come to the island with
the mysterious visitor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>Neither of the boys had obtained a clear look at
him until Fred suggested, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?
We&rsquo;re making a mountain out of a molehill.
Come on, let&rsquo;s go and speak to the man on board
the motor-boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John hesitated a moment and then quickly followed
his friend, as they advanced openly along
the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see who that is?&rdquo; whispered Fred,
clutching John by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; answered John. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that little
Jap that we saw on Cockburn Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly who it is. What do you suppose
he&rsquo;s doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not doing much of anything just now.
I should guess that he is in charge of the boat
until his boss comes back. I&rsquo;m going to hail
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In response to John&rsquo;s hail the little Japanese
quickly turned and glanced in the direction from
which the unexpected call had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t understand English, don&rsquo;t you remember?&rdquo;
said Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know he pretended that he didn&rsquo;t, but we&rsquo;ll
see how much he knows now. Got anything to
eat on board?&rdquo; called John, turning once more
toward the motor-boat.</p>
<p>The first feeling of alarm or surprise had passed
and the little manservant now broke into another
of his loud and unmusical laughs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Got any breakfast? Got anything on board to
eat?&rdquo; again called John.</p>
<p>It was plain now that the Japanese understood
what was said, for in broken English he explained
that he had some articles of food on the motor-boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if you&rsquo;ll sell us some?&rdquo; inquired Fred
eagerly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come aboard and see what you
have got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly taking the stranger&rsquo;s skiff the boys
rowed out to the motor-boat and after they had
made it fast, stepped on board.</p>
<p>The Japanese seldom spoke, but in a brief time
he handed each of the boys two sandwiches, which
they eagerly took and quickly ate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much do we owe you?&rdquo; asked John.</p>
<p>Again laughing loudly the Japanese shook his
head and it was manifest that they would be unable
to pay for the slight repast they had received.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you come from Cockburn Island?&rdquo;
inquired Fred.</p>
<p>The question was not answered and John quickly
broke in, &ldquo;When are you going back? That&rsquo;s a
good deal more to the purpose. Do you suppose
your boss would be willing to take us over to
Mackinac?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Japanese laughed, but still did not answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pay him well for it,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;How
far is this place from Mackinac anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Bout forty mile,&rdquo; answered the Japanese.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a good ways out
of our course, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">ANOTHER MYSTERIOUS LETTER</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care much how far we are away if
we can only get back,&rdquo; said John thoughtfully.</p>
<p>It was apparent, however, that extended conversation
with the little Japanese would be impossible.
He had made no inquiries as to why the
boys were on the island and except for his first
expression of surprise when he had heard their
hail, he did not give any sign of special interest
either in them or in their doings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We stove a hole in the bottom of our skiff,&rdquo;
explained John. &ldquo;Have you got a piece of tin
and some tacks or something we can mend it
with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You no feex it?&rdquo; inquired the Japanese.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t anything to fix it with,&rdquo; explained
John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go see,&rdquo; volunteered the little man.</p>
<p>In accordance with his suggestion the boys
speedily rowed ashore, the little Japanese accompanying
them, and led the way to the cove where
their skiff was resting on the beach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>The Japanese made a careful investigation of
the injury to the skiff and then said, after he had
once more laughed loudly, &ldquo;I feex her.&rdquo; Quickly
turning he ran back to the skiff and returned to
the motor-boat. Only a few minutes elapsed before
once more he came back and the very implements
John had sought with which to repair the
boat were now in his hands.</p>
<p>Deftly he drove caulking into the seams and the
cracks and then taking a piece of tin tacked it on
the bottom of the skiff over the spot where the
break had occurred. Then once more he used the
caulking, driving it in all about the place where
the skiff had been struck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He no sink now,&rdquo; said the Japanese, at last
standing back and with pride viewing his workmanship.
&ldquo;He no sink now. She just as good as
new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Declining the offer of the boys to pay him for
his labor the Japanese seated himself upon a rock
and looked steadily at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for have you come here?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had bad luck last evening,&rdquo; explained
John. &ldquo;We started from Cockburn Island in the
<i>Gadabout</i> but we got out of our course. Then the
first thing we knew our gasoline was gone and we
had an accident in the shaft or the blades of the
propeller. We thought that we might be able to
get some help, so two of us left the boat and started
ashore in our skiff. But we lost our way and
that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re here and not where we want to
be.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where other man?&rdquo; inquired the Japanese.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What other man? Do you mean Mr. Ferdinand
Button?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah. Where Mr. Button now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very question that we would like
to have you answer for us,&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t know whether the <i>Gadabout</i> is lost somewhere
or the other fellows think we are lost and
have gone back to Mackinac. That&rsquo;s why we want
to go back there ourselves and we&rsquo;ll pay well if
you&rsquo;ll take us there on board your boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time the Japanese did not laugh, but there
was a peculiar expression that appeared for an
instant in his eyes and that alarmed John, although
Fred had not seen that which so greatly troubled
his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When are you going back?&rdquo; demanded John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got anything more to eat on board
your boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the strange laughter was heard but
the Japanese did not reply to the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be two hours before they start, the Jap
says,&rdquo; said Fred, turning to John as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there isn&rsquo;t anything to do except to wait
for the time to come, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; observed John. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait until that
man comes back here and then we&rsquo;ll tell him of our
troubles and I&rsquo;m sure he will take us on board.
If he won&rsquo;t take us to Mackinac at least he will
take us back to his house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he will,&rdquo; responded Fred somewhat
dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he comes, anyway,&rdquo; said John quickly,
as glancing toward the woods he discovered the
man approaching, who was the subject of their
conversation.</p>
<p>The boys waited until the man drew near and
when he discovered their presence his remarks
were not complimentary to either of his would-be
passengers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I cannot take either one of you,&rdquo; he
said positively. &ldquo;I have something else to do. In
fact I have got to do it. I cannot go to Mackinac
to-day under any circumstances. But what are
you two boys doing here? You haven&rsquo;t explained
that yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;just why we&rsquo;re
here. About all that we know is that we are here
and we want to get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you propose to leave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want you to take us on your motor-boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I have already explained to you,&rdquo; said
the stranger, &ldquo;why I cannot do that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pay you well for it,&rdquo; suggested Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a question of pay,&rdquo; said the man.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s simply a question of my not being able to do
what you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how are we going to get away from this
place? Is this the mainland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s an island. It is commonly called
Western Duck Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which means that there are other duck islands
farther to the east and that we&rsquo;re not on the mainland
shore at all?&rdquo; said Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. You are several miles from shore.
About all the island is good for is for hunting.
A little later you might find a good many ducks
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t want to be here until &lsquo;a little
later,&rsquo;&rdquo; protested Fred. &ldquo;We want to leave
right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t see anything for you to do except
to try to cross in your skiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Jap says it&rsquo;s about forty miles from here
to Mackinac.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he says so then he probably is correct. I
haven&rsquo;t known Mike to be wrong many times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cannot sail back in our skiff,&rdquo; explained
John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t see anything for you to do except
to stay here and wait until you hail some boat that
is passing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How long will that be?&rdquo; inquired Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not knowing, I cannot say. But on a day like
this, which promises to be very clear and pleasant,
there ought to be a good many boats passing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we&rsquo;ll have better luck with them than
we had with you,&rdquo; said John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; responded the man, &ldquo;and with all
my heart. All I can say is this, that if you don&rsquo;t
get any one to take you away before six o&rsquo;clock
this afternoon I will stop here on my way back
and take you aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are we going to get anything to eat?&rdquo;
asked John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;I
will tell Mike to give you some sandwiches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has done that already,&rdquo; said John.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there some place where we can get something
to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know of any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought perhaps that man you met out
here might be living here and he or his wife would
be willing to sell us some food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What man are you talking about?&rdquo; demanded
the stranger, quickly turning to the boys as he
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the one that met you out here between
the shore and the woods yonder,&rdquo; explained John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see any one?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly did,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;We saw you
meet a man out here and hand him something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred was convinced that there was a momentary
gleam of anger or alarm in the expression of the
stranger&rsquo;s face, but if so the feeling quickly departed.
In a low voice the man said, &ldquo;There are
some great stories told about this island. My advice
to you is not to stay any longer than you are
compelled to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And our feeling is,&rdquo; laughed Fred somewhat
ruefully, &ldquo;that any time we spend here is wasted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll have to stay,&rdquo; said the man as
he went back and stepped on board his skiff. He
then pushed out from the shore and speedily resumed
his place on board the motor-boat.</p>
<p>The anchor was hauled in and in a brief time
the fleet little craft had resumed its voyage, headed
now for the southern point of Western Duck Island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That beats anything I have ever seen. I tell
you, Fred, there&rsquo;s something wrong here. Don&rsquo;t
you think we had better go back in the woods and
see if we cannot find that man who came out of
there a little while ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might as well do that as anything,&rdquo; assented
Fred, and quickly climbing the bank once
more, they started across the field which intervened
between them and the woods. As nearly as
possible they were following the path taken by the
others some time before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>They had not gone far, however, before John
suddenly stopped and picked up an envelope
which he saw lying on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all things in the world!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;What do you think of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Handing the envelope to Fred he called his attention
to the name typewritten on the outside:
&ldquo;Mr. Button.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for you, Fred,&rdquo; laughed John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is,&rdquo; said Fred, &ldquo;then somebody had the
pleasure of reading my letter before I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The envelope has been opened,&rdquo; suggested
John; &ldquo;suppose you read the letter. It may be
for you. Very likely some of the people here
heard you were coming and they are getting ready
to welcome us. This is the royal proclamation
for you. That man told us we&rsquo;re on an island and
if we are I guess Robinson Crusoe didn&rsquo;t have
very much on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred meanwhile was reading the letter and it
was manifest from his expression that he was
startled or puzzled by what he read. At last he
handed the letter to John, simply saying, &ldquo;Our
patriotic and mysterious friend has made another
mistake. This letter is not for me but for Mr.
Ferdinand Button.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose it is doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Fred, &ldquo;unless the man
dropped it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s not Mr. Ferdinand Button,&rdquo; protested
John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more he isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; acknowledged Fred, &ldquo;but
that isn&rsquo;t the only strange thing about it. Read
the letter, John, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus bidden, John read the following letter,&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">Dear Sir:</p>
<p class="bq">I enclose you an envelope with my address. Send my your
answer as soon as you possible this afternoon. I will get it
in Macinac tonight or tomorrow morning and will immediately
come to see you.</p>
<p class="bq">To deliver you this gang which rob United States of thousands
of dollars each year. I only want two things. 1st.
My ticket to Montreal and back. 2nd. My passage to Europe
by way of the Azores Isles. I do not want money. You
will pay me <i>when the gang is in your hands</i>. You will get
it this afternoonday. Do not fail to send me your answer
quick. If you do so I will have the gang in your lands in
2 weeks. They are 2 men and 1 woman and they smuggle
by ways you are not at all suspicious.</p>
<p class="bq"><span class="rj1">Truly yours,</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Button certainly has a good many friends
and they are trying to keep him well informed.
What do you make of this anyway, Fred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t make much of anything,&rdquo; said Fred
thoughtfully. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of going any
farther? Let&rsquo;s go back and take our skiff and see
if we can&rsquo;t get somewhere. The lake is smooth
this morning and we may be able to get back as
far as Drummond or Cockburn Island.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>When the boys returned to the shore the motor-boat
had disappeared from sight. This strange
disappearance, however, was not so confusing to
the boys as the discovery they speedily made concerning
the skiff which they themselves had left
on the shore of the cove.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">A SIGNAL OF DISTRESS</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Where did that sail come from?&rdquo; demanded
John, as he stopped abruptly
and looked in astonishment at
the little skiff. Thrown carelessly across it was a
sail and small mast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did they come from?&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t put them there,&rdquo; replied Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any more about it than you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, somebody has been good to us and tried
to help us get away from this deserted island.
What did that man say the name of it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Western Duck Island. There are a half-dozen
of these islands, I remember now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t feel very badly if I never see nor hear
of them again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all right now. We have a sail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we are, though I haven&rsquo;t forgotten
that that little Jap said we are forty miles from
Mackinac.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is forty miles to fellows who have got a
boat and a sail?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>While the two boys were talking they had adjusted
the mast and rigged the little leg-of-mutton
sail. It was plain to both boys that if conditions
continued favorable they had found an easier way
by which they could return to their hotel than by
trying to row.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; called Fred cheerily, his courage
now having returned in full measure. &ldquo;Come on.
Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s stay here any longer than we have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you,&rdquo; responded John. &ldquo;Now who&rsquo;s
going to sail this boat first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are, by unanimous consent; I think it will
be safer for the crew to have you sitting in the
stern than it will be to have you crawling around
the bow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mystery of the sail had not been explained,
but whoever had left it plainly had intended that
it should be used.</p>
<p>The wind was light but the little skiff drew rapidly
away from the shore of Western Duck Island,
and as he glanced behind him Fred said, &ldquo;I feel
almost as Columbus must have felt when he set
forth in his three tubs to find a new world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew that Columbus sailed in three
boats before,&rdquo; laughed John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that Columbus himself sailed
in three boats, at least at the same time. I used
his name as the name of his whole party. I forgot
for the minute what kind of material I was dealing
with.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Never you mind that,&rdquo; retorted John. &ldquo;You
just watch me while I sail this boat. I&rsquo;m going to
head her up the shore toward Drummond Island.
If we can make that I think we&rsquo;ll be all right for
the rest of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if we don&rsquo;t make it what are you going to
do?&rdquo; said Fred more seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be time enough for me to explain to you,
my friend, when the occasion arrives. Meanwhile
just see how smoothly we are speeding on
our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re almost a poet,&rdquo; laughed Fred, &ldquo;and
there isn&rsquo;t wind enough to lift a feather. I think
I&rsquo;ll take the oars and row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John offered no objection and Fred accordingly
seated himself and began to row.</p>
<p>The day was warm and the beams of the sun,
which now was high in the eastern sky, were
strongly reflected from the smooth waters of
Lake Huron. Indeed, it was not long before the
wind died away and the boys were nearly becalmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re almost as idle as a painted ship upon a
painted ocean, aren&rsquo;t we, Jack?&rdquo; demanded Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we are not,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;Not at all,
thank you. We&rsquo;re not idle and we&rsquo;re not going
to be. I&rsquo;m going to have my crew keep on rowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll set a good example.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I intend to do,&rdquo; said John.
&ldquo;You change places with me and I&rsquo;ll show you
how the thing ought to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without expressing the thought in his mind
each boy was keeping a sharp outlook over the
waters for the swift little <i>Gadabout</i>. Both somehow
were expecting that the motor-boat either had
not departed from the region or would surely return
when morning came.</p>
<p>An hour or more had elapsed, however, and no
trace of the <i>Gadabout</i> had been discovered. Far
away over the waters the faint trace of smoke left
by the passing lake steamers could be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a great job we have been thrown into,
isn&rsquo;t it, Jack?&rdquo; demanded Fred at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think it is,&rdquo; acknowledged John.
&ldquo;That letter of yours seems to make it worse,
though. For the life of me I cannot understand
how it came to Western Duck Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe that man dropped it,&rdquo; suggested Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean the smuggler?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s what he is all right. I don&rsquo;t
know what his name is yet, but I mean the man
that has a house over there on Cockburn Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man I mean,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;I think
he&rsquo;s a smuggler. He may be, but the thing that
puzzles me most is how he got your letter, if he
was the one that dropped it over here on Western
Duck Island.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s hard to explain,&rdquo; assented Fred,
&ldquo;but I guess if we knew more about it we wouldn&rsquo;t
find it quite so hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? Do you think that man
wrote the letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I don&rsquo;t mean very much of anything.
Fred, do you see how this boat is leaking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Startled by the abrupt question, Fred glanced
quickly at the spot in the bottom of the boat which
the little Japanese had repaired. The water certainly
was coming into the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think, Jack?&rdquo; demanded Fred
quickly. &ldquo;Shall we try to go back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the direction in which we usually go?&rdquo;
retorted John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather go back than go down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I would rather go ahead than either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the boat is certainly leaking. We have
seen one storm on the lake and we don&rsquo;t want to
be caught in another, especially with a leaking old
tub like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any storm and we aren&rsquo;t caught
yet. Besides, I feel a little puff of wind,&rdquo; John
added, as he turned his face in the direction from
which the wind appeared to be coming.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>John had been rowing for a half-hour or longer,
and perspiration was streaming down his face.
Close to the water the air was cool, but as there
was no breeze it was well-nigh impossible for any
one working as hard as John had been to cool himself
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a little puff,&rdquo; he added, and once more
the sail was hoisted and for a little while the skiff
moved steadily forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; suggested Fred a little later, &ldquo;I think
the best thing for us to do is to try to get in the
course of those lake boats. We can&rsquo;t see the shore
of Duck Island any longer and if we go far enough
over to the west and our skiff sinks, it may be that
some one of those boats will pick us up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether or not it was the swifter action of the
skiff the leak steadily was becoming more apparent.
Indeed, after a brief time Fred said, &ldquo;Is
there anything on board we can use to bail this
boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen anything,&rdquo; answered John, and
a hasty search quickly revealed the fact that there
was no implement on board which could be used
in the manner indicated by Fred.</p>
<p>The latter, however, taking his cap did his utmost
to dip out the water, which was steadily
increasing in the bottom of the skiff, into the lake.
His efforts were unavailing, however, and in a
brief time the boy, now thoroughly alarmed, arose
and said, &ldquo;I tell you, Jack, this boat isn&rsquo;t going to
stay afloat very long.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>John made no reply, but as he turned to look
behind him Fred also glanced in that direction, but
the island from which they had departed had
long since disappeared from sight.</p>
<p>Far away in the west occasional trails of smoke
could be seen, although both boys were aware that
doubtless such indications of the passing of the
steamers came within their vision long after the
vessels themselves had disappeared from the region.</p>
<p>It was speedily becoming manifest that the boys
would be compelled to struggle desperately in
order to keep their sinking craft afloat. They
both clearly understood that they were Go Ahead
Boys and were not to give up easily, but the water
was entering faster now and the peril consequently
became more threatening with every passing moment.</p>
<p>Almost in despair John looked toward the low
lying streak of dark cloud in the west which he
clearly understood indicated the course of a passing
lake-boat. The mast meanwhile had been
taken down and no attempt was made to sail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s throw that thing overboard,&rdquo; suggested
Fred in a voice sounding strangely, even in his
own ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the mast and sail.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Cut the sail and throw it overboard,&rdquo; ordered
John, &ldquo;but save the mast as long as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; demanded Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hand me your handkerchief and I&rsquo;ll show
you,&rdquo; answered John. Speedily tying his own
handkerchief to Fred&rsquo;s he then fastened both to
the top of the mast. &ldquo;Somebody may see our signal
of distress,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull, Fred! Pull for all you&rsquo;re worth!&rdquo; he
hastily added. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get nearer the
boats if we ever make shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Fred rowed, John was doing his utmost to
bail the boat. He was using his hands and his
cap, but even with his utmost endeavors the depth
of the water in the slowly moving skiff did not decrease.
Both boys were toiling desperately now.
Their faces were red and streaked with perspiration.
There was no evading the fact, however,
that in spite of all their efforts their progress still
was slow and the peril of sinking was steadily increasing.</p>
<p>At the mast-head floated the signal of distress.
Neither of the boys was speaking now and the
silence that rested on the great stretch of waters
was unbroken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">THE SINKING SKIFF</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t be able to stay on board
much longer,&rdquo; said Fred in a low
voice.</p>
<p>John made no reply, but his colorless face was
clearly seen by his companion, who was fully
aware of the anxiety in the heart of his friend.</p>
<p>Steadily the little boat was sinking into the
waters of Lake Huron. The boys now were wet
to their waists and it was manifest that they would
not much longer be able to remain in the little skiff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she won&rsquo;t sink,&rdquo; called Fred. &ldquo;Perhaps
we can keep afloat if we hang to her after she
settles down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still John made no response. Not very long before
he had been the one to try to cheer his companion.
He it was who had declared that they
had never learned to go backward and that they
must be Go Ahead Boys to the end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use, Jack,&rdquo; called Fred. &ldquo;We
can&rsquo;t stay here any longer. Get your shoes off, if
you can.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>With difficulty each boy removed his shoes and
unmindful of his sweater and their other belongings
prepared to leap into the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take the bow, Jack, and I&rsquo;ll hang to the
stern,&rdquo; called Fred. &ldquo;If we each put only one
hand on the boat, she may stay afloat long enough
to keep us from sinking. Don&rsquo;t lose your head.
Just remember that we aren&rsquo;t through this fight
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both boys were expert swimmers, although their
skill now was of slight avail. It was impossible
for them to see the shore of the island from which
they had departed and only the low-lying trails of
dark smoke indicated what might be on the water
far to the west.</p>
<p>Together the boys leaped into the water. The
boat partly righted itself when it was relieved of
its burden, but it was so full of water that only a
few inches below the gunwale appeared above the
surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Jack,&rdquo; called Fred as the boys arose
to the surface, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s turn this tub over so that it
will be bottom upward. Maybe it will stay afloat
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred was peering anxiously at his friend, fearful
that his courage had gone and that he would be
compelled to exert himself to his utmost in order
to force John to any action.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>Whether or not it was the effect of the cool
water, John&rsquo;s courage apparently had returned.
At all events in response to the call of his friend
he swam quickly toward the boat. Acting upon
the directions of Fred he placed one hand on the
bow while Fred seized the stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now turn her over,&rdquo; called Fred and under
the united action of the boys the leaking boat
speedily reversed its position and lay upon the
water, keel upward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can keep afloat here all day,&rdquo; said Fred,
speaking with a confidence he was far from feeling.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to be careful, but if we rest only
one hand on the boat that will keep us afloat and I
don&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;ll sink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both were aware now of the desperate plight in
which they found themselves. There were no indications
of help within sight and each understood
that unless help came before sunset they were
likely to become so chilled by their long stay in the
cool waters that they would be unable longer to
retain their hold. Before the mind of Fred there
came a momentary vision of his far away home.
For an instant he fancied he could imagine the
scene when the report was received there of the
loss of their boy. &ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; he called, his voice
breaking in spite of his efforts at self-control, &ldquo;if
anything happens to either of us it is understood,
isn&rsquo;t it, that the other fellow will send word?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>It was John&rsquo;s turn now to manifest a strong
determination and facing his friend he said,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give up the ship yet! We have most of
the day before us and something will happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could get that mast over yonder
and rig it on the bottom of the skiff. Perhaps
some one might see that when they couldn&rsquo;t see us.
We are so close to the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good suggestion,&rdquo; said John.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going ahead yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly releasing his grasp John swam toward
the floating mast, which had been lost when the
skiff was overturned.</p>
<p>He easily secured it and swam back to the overturned
skiff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you break a hole in the bottom, Jack?&rdquo;
asked Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I&rsquo;ll try it,&rdquo; responded John.
Pounding upon the bottom of the skiff where it had
been broken when the boat had struck the rock, he
succeeded in making a hole big enough to enable
him to thrust the mast into the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the handkerchiefs,&rdquo; called Fred;
&ldquo;they will dry out and will be floating in the breeze
pretty soon. Now the main thing for us to do is
simply to hang on and wait until somebody sees
that signal of distress.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>The moments passed slowly and to both boys
there came an increasing fear that their plight was
not likely to attract the attention of passing boats.
Indeed, apparently there were no boats passing
nearby. The low clouds of smoke in the distance
were tantalizing in their effect upon the minds of
the watching boys.</p>
<p>They had no means of estimating the passing of
the time. Occasionally they glanced toward the
sky into which the sun was steadily mounting, but
they were neither in a condition to reflect calmly
and so were unable to decide whether they had
been in the water an hour or longer.</p>
<p>To their delight the skiff seemed to be easily
able to hold them up in the water. Occasionally
Fred let go his hold and swam about in the water
to &lsquo;start his circulation once more.&rsquo; Both were
becoming chilled, although it was not yet midday.</p>
<p>At last the sun reached the zenith and slowly began
its descent. The boys now were silent, for
conversation had ceased long before this time.
Each was watching the other, fearful that the
strength of his friend was giving out. In such
an event he was aware that he would be unable to
render any positive assistance, as his own strength
was steadily departing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look yonder,&rdquo; said Fred in a low voice when
another hour had elapsed. As he spoke he glanced
behind him and John quickly looked in the direction
he indicated.</p>
<p>Not very far distant was a lake boat which apparently
was passing far out of the usual course of
the steamers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose,&rdquo; inquired Fred, &ldquo;if we should
shout together we might make them hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can try it,&rdquo; answered John.</p>
<p>Accordingly both boys united in a loud and prolonged
call. For a time it seemed to both of them
that their efforts were unavailing. The ungainly
boat was so far away that it was well-nigh impossible
for either to determine whether or not it had
veered slightly in its course.</p>
<p>Convinced that their cry had not been heard both
again lapsed into silence though each was still
eagerly watching the movements of the distant
vessel.</p>
<p>Several minutes had passed when John said
eagerly, &ldquo;Fred, I believe that boat is coming this
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Fred was silent as he peered still
more eagerly at the lake boat. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see it,&rdquo;
he said disconsolately. &ldquo;I cannot find that she&rsquo;s
any nearer than she was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think it is,&rdquo; affirmed John sturdily.
&ldquo;Hang on and we&rsquo;ll see if she doesn&rsquo;t come to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John&rsquo;s confident statement, however, was not
fulfilled. As if it was unmindful of the peril or
the presence of the two boys in their plight, the
boat continued steadily on its way until it disappeared
from sight.</p>
<p>Neither of the boys spoke, but their feeling of
depression was steadily deepening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a loaded boat coming from the other
direction,&rdquo; said John after another hour had
elapsed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s out of its course, too. Let&rsquo;s
try it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as Fred had looked eagerly in the direction
indicated by John he saw another lake boat
standing high in the water and evidently bound
northward. It was plain that it was not loaded
as heavily as the boat which had disappeared in
the opposite direction and it also was moving much
more rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try another yell,&rdquo; suggested John when
at last the boat was on a line parallel with their
own.</p>
<p>The call of the boys was hoarse and not so loud
as the one in which they had united in their former
effort.</p>
<p>After several attempts the boys waited breathlessly,
while in an anxiety they could not express
they watched the ungainly craft as it sped over the
lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; called Fred suddenly, &ldquo;I believe that
tub is changing its course and is coming in our direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John made no response, but when a few moments
had elapsed it was plain that for some reason the
boat had veered in its course and swinging to the
right was plainly coming nearer to the place where
the boys were clinging to the skiff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>On and still on came the noisy steamer until the
strokes of its blades in the water could be distinctly
heard.</p>
<p>Several times the boys united in shouts, but at
last it was plainly manifest that their signal of distress
had been discovered and that the lake boat
had turned to rescue the victims of the sinking
skiff. <a href="#front">Not long afterward a yawl was lowered
from the boat and two men took their places at
the oars.</a> With strong and steady sweeps they
drew near the boys and not many minutes afterward
quickly dragged both on board the yawl.</p>
<p>The reaction had come to both John and Fred
and neither was able to sit erect. Their teeth were
chattering as if both were suffering from an ague.
Indeed, neither boy was fully aware of the events
which were occurring until at last they were somehow
brought on board the lake boat. There were
willing hands to assist them there and speedily
they were taken below, where their wet clothing
was removed and after a thorough rub-down by
rough but friendly hands they were placed in bunks
and covered with blankets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">THE RESCUE OF THE GADABOUT</span></h2>
<p>Meanwhile on the <i>Gadabout</i> George
and Grant were having experiences that
by no means added to their peace of
mind.</p>
<p>For a time they had waited with such patience
as they could command for the return of their
friends. But when the minutes became hours and
there still was no sign of the coming of Fred and
John both boys began to be anxious.</p>
<p>The little <i>Gadabout</i> had been steadily drifting
with the slowly moving current and in the dim
light it was no longer possible to discern the outline
of the shore which Fred and John had been
seeking.</p>
<p>The feeling of uneasiness steadily increased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose has happened to those
boys?&rdquo; inquired Grant of his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe anything has happened to
them,&rdquo; replied George. &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s just the
trouble. They haven&rsquo;t found the shore, or any
one to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then why don&rsquo;t they come back?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you. You know as much about that
as I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m afraid they&rsquo;re lost,&rdquo; said Grant disconsolately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe anything very serious can happen
to them even if they have lost their way,&rdquo; said
George, striving to speak with an assurance he did
not fully share. &ldquo;Even if they stay out there until
morning,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;they wouldn&rsquo;t have
anything to be afraid of. And then they would be
able to find somebody that would pick them up and
take them back to Mackinac. Very likely we&rsquo;ll
find them there when we get back ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose a storm comes up,&rdquo; suggested
Grant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t begin to worry until the wind begins
to blow,&rdquo; said George testily. The fear of
the same event was in his own mind, but he resented
the suggestion of his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is about time for us to be getting
worried about ourselves,&rdquo; said George at last,
when the first faint streaks of the dawn were seen
in the eastern sky. &ldquo;Fred and John at least can
be moving while we are here as helpless as a rat
in a trap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of him?&rdquo; inquired Grant in
a whisper, nodding toward Mr. Button as he spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>He was still seated near the wheel and had given
but slight attention to his companions. Evidently
he was anxious concerning something, though what
it was that disturbed him was still not clear to his
two young companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think, Mr. Button?&rdquo; called
George. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s become of the boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! What&rsquo;s that you say?&rdquo; inquired Mr.
Button, sitting quickly erect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think has become of Jack and
Fred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Mr. Button vaguely.
&ldquo;Where did they go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, they left in the skiff,&rdquo; explained Grant.
&ldquo;They have been gone three or four hours anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they come back?&rdquo; inquired Mr.
Button.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we want to know. We&rsquo;re afraid
they are lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they won&rsquo;t be lost very long,&rdquo; said Mr.
Button. &ldquo;Somebody will pick them up and take
them back to Mackinac Island. That isn&rsquo;t more
than forty miles away anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re afraid somebody may not find
them,&rdquo; said Grant. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t see any boats
anywhere around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke the boy stood erect and looked in
all directions over the smooth waters of Lake
Huron. As was the case with Fred and John the
only indications of boats anywhere in the vicinity
were the long low trails of smoke that could be
seen far in the west.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How are we going to get back, Mr. Button?&rdquo;
inquired George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Mr. Button. &ldquo;I think
we&rsquo;ll have to wait for somebody to pick us up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there isn&rsquo;t any boat anywhere around
here,&rdquo; protested Grant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be before night,&rdquo; said Mr. Button
quietly. &ldquo;And besides we cannot do anything to
call any one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might try yelling together,&rdquo; suggested
George.</p>
<p>Mr. Button smiled, but made no response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we had some oars or a little sail we might do
something,&rdquo; suggested Grant. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
look around and see if there isn&rsquo;t a sail on board
anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His search was unrewarded, however, and at
last when Grant returned it was agreed that their
only hope was in being recognized by some passing
vessel.</p>
<p>The anxiety of the two boys for the safety of
their missing comrades was not relieved when later
in the afternoon a lake boat changing its course
approached the place where they were lying.</p>
<p>Evidently they had been discovered by the captain,
who was still holding his glasses in his hand
as the boat drew near.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I found a megaphone under the seat,&rdquo; suggested
Grant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it? Go get it,&rdquo; suggested George.</p>
<p>In a moment Grant was again on deck and
handed the megaphone to Mr. Button.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahoy, there!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Will you give us a
tow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; came back the answer from the
deck of the huge boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are three of us and our motor-boat broke
down last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you been here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, since midnight anyway. You are the
first boat that has come anywhere near us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s just by luck that we saw you. What
will you do, come aboard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Mr. Button, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll give us
a line we would rather have you tow us. Are you
going anywhere near Mackinac Island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the captain. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re bound
straight for there. I don&rsquo;t know that we shall
stop, but we&rsquo;ll fix it so that you can get ashore if
you want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do splendidly,&rdquo; called Mr. Button.</p>
<p>In a brief time the two boats were near enough
to enable a sailor to cast a rope to the <i>Gadabout</i>.
After one or two attempts this was successfully
seized and then made fast. As the lake boat
swung around to resume its course, the <i>Gadabout</i>,
one hundred feet or more astern, followed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to go back and leave the other fellows
out here,&rdquo; said George when they began to move
swiftly over the waters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to worry about them,&rdquo; said
Mr. Button. &ldquo;If we could see them anywhere
that would be one thing, but they have disappeared
from sight. They have a good skiff and I
think I heard you say that they both were Go
Ahead Boys. If they are, they will get out of their
trouble all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I hope so,&rdquo; said George dubiously.</p>
<p>The conversation, however, ceased, and for a
time all three were silent. The clear waters of
Lake Huron bubbled and seethed as they were
cut by the bow of the swift little motor-boat.</p>
<p>The huge lake boat evidently was not carrying
a load and its speed accordingly was unhampered.
Doubtless the giant boat was returning to Duluth
for another cargo of wheat or iron.</p>
<p>The progress was uninterrupted so that by the
middle of the afternoon the high, rocky shores of
Mackinac Island became visible in the distance.</p>
<p>At that moment the captain appeared at the
stern of the lake boat and raising his megaphone
to his mouth, called, &ldquo;Do you want us to land
you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Mr. Button also speaking through
a megaphone, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll find somebody that will take
us in. If you&rsquo;re not going to land there you
needn&rsquo;t stop on our account. How much do we
owe you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t owe us anything,&rdquo; called the captain.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re glad to lend a hand. Whenever
you say the word you can cast off and we&rsquo;ll haul
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half-hour later Mr. Button announced through
his megaphone that the time had arrived when
there was no longer need for them to be towed.
They could plainly see the yachts in the harbor and
the people moving along the streets. To enter the
harbor would compel the huge boat to change its
course, an act which no one desired.</p>
<p>Accordingly after hailing the crew and expressing
the thanks of himself and his companions for
the aid they had received, Mr. Button gave the
word and the little <i>Gadabout</i> was set free from the
great steamer.</p>
<p>Another motor-boat near by, the occupants of
which were deeply interested spectators of what
was occurring, at once took the <i>Gadabout</i> in tow
and noisily proceeded toward the wharf which was
not more than two hundred yards away.</p>
<p>There were many questions asked of the rescued
party, all of which were promptly answered, but as
soon as the boys landed they at once began to
make inquiries for a boat which could be chartered
for a search for their missing friends.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>At last, however, they listened to the persuasions
of Mr. Button and went up to the hotel where they
obtained a dinner, which satisfied them after their
long fast.</p>
<p>Then, quickly returning to the dock they found
their boat awaiting them and at once stepped on
board.</p>
<p>Already they had explained to the owner the
peril of the friends and the reason why they had
chartered the swiftest boat which could be obtained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be there before long,&rdquo; said the captain
confidently. &ldquo;Have you brought anything for
your friends to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we have a basket full here,&rdquo; explained
George, pointing to a hamper which one of the
waiters from the hotel had placed on board. &ldquo;We
thought they would be hungry so we got it ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, they will be,&rdquo; said the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose anything has happened to
them, do you?&rdquo; inquired George anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s something no man knows,&rdquo; replied the
captain not unkindly, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll soon find out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">THE SEARCH FOR THE LOST BOYS</span></h2>
<p>The impatience of the boys was manifest
when the swift little boat set forth on its
voyage. Already they had made thorough
investigations about the island, but not a
word concerning their missing friends had been
heard.</p>
<p>The anxiety of both George and Grant was well-nigh
overpowering, although both did their utmost
to heed the comforting words of the captain
of the little yacht.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry none,&rdquo; he said cheerily.
&ldquo;Them boys will take care of themselves. It was
a ca&rsquo;m night and the only way those fellows could
git into trouble would be by trying to run into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Fred may have done,&rdquo; said
George dryly. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s anything of that kind
around he usually finds it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ll find the boys all right,&rdquo; affirmed
the captain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>Striving to calm their fears the boys gazed out
over the smooth waters. For two days now the
surface of Lake Huron had been almost unruffled.
Such gentle breezes as were blowing produced only
the slightest ripple on the surface. In the clear
waters, objects on the shore were reflected almost
as in a mirror.</p>
<p>None of these things, however, was in the
thoughts of the two boys as they watched the bluffs
of Mackinac Island fade away in the distance.</p>
<p>They had done their utmost to describe to their
captain the location in which they had left their
friends the preceding night. That bluff individual
had heartily declared that he understood just
where the accident had occurred, but somehow his
confidence was not fully shared by either of his
passengers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He tries to make up for what he doesn&rsquo;t know
by stating with all his might the things he does
know,&rdquo; said George in a low voice to Grant when
the boys had taken their seats near the stern of the
boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what some people say,&rdquo; answered
Grant. &ldquo;&lsquo;A lie well stuck to is as good as the
truth.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that,&rdquo; said George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That a lie ever is as good as the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that. I said a lie well stuck to
was as good as the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it is ever right to lie.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I do,&rdquo; said Grant positively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, if you were dreadfully sick and it would
be a shock to you to know that you were likely to
die I think it would be all right to lie and tell you
that you looked well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would know that was a lie just as soon as you
said it,&rdquo; laughed George, &ldquo;but I wouldn&rsquo;t lie even
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would do nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, suppose you had to say something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would say what I thought was true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you lie if the doctor told you to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I tell you I don&rsquo;t believe a lie is ever
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in lieing in general, but I can
see times when I think it might be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble is, when a fellow begins he goes
ahead. He doesn&rsquo;t stop with lies that may not be
so bad, but he keeps on and tries it in a good many
other ways. No, sir, I haven&rsquo;t any use for a liar.
If I give my word I intend to keep it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>Conversation ceased and both boys anxiously
were peering before them. The captain already
had explained that they were doubtless near the
shore of Western Duck Island where their accident
had occurred and their companions had been lost.
He had explained also that in his judgment it was
wisest to go again to the same spot as nearly as
possible and there begin their search for the missing
boys. He sturdily maintained his feeling that
the boys were not &ldquo;lost,&rdquo; a confidence, however,
that was not shared by his passengers as the boat
swiftly sped across the surface of the shining
waters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sometimes think the captain is right,&rdquo; said
George thoughtfully. &ldquo;Last night was as calm
as a night could well be and, as he said, if the fellows
got into trouble they must have tried to look
it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you,&rdquo; said Grant, although the
tones of his voice failed to show any strong conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry none about them boys,&rdquo; called
the captain again as he saw George and Grant
anxiously conferring. &ldquo;If they are any kind of
boys they will take care of themselves. Why, I
wouldn&rsquo;t give much for a lad that couldn&rsquo;t protect
himself in such a night as last night was. Up on
Mackinac Island I have known people who lived
for months on fried snowballs. They are not very
good as a diet, but they help to keep people from
thinking too much about their troubles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither of the boys responded to the flippant
words of their captain, although both were aware
that he was speaking out of the kindness of his
heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>When nearly three hours had elapsed after they
had departed from Mackinac the captain, once
more turning to his passengers, said, &ldquo;Yonder lie
the shores of Western Duck Island.&rdquo; As he
spoke he pointed to a low lying strip of land that
could be seen far in advance of them. &ldquo;My opinion
is,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that those boys didn&rsquo;t stay
out in their boat all night. Maybe they landed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is anybody living on the island?&rdquo; said George
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not regular. This time of the year though
there may be parties camping out. A bit later in
the fall there are plenty of people there shooting
ducks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t do us any good,&rdquo; retorted
George. &ldquo;What we want is to find out where those
fellows are now and if they got any help on the
island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wait a bit,&rdquo; rejoined the captain, &ldquo;and
we&rsquo;ll find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swiftly the little motor-boat approached the
shores of the island they were seeking. It too
passed the long strip of rushes which had been
seen the preceding night by John and Fred in their
attempts to find a landing place.</p>
<p>The motor-boat at last came to anchor off a
rocky shore and at the suggestion of the captain
George and Grant climbed into the skiff and hastily
casting off at once rowed ashore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait for you here,&rdquo; called the captain as
the boys clambered up on the bank. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t
be gone more than an hour. Come back and we&rsquo;ll
try it farther down the shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys agreed to return within the specified
time and then after peering eagerly all about them
together started toward the woods they could see
in the distance.</p>
<p>Just why they walked in this direction neither
could explain, but there was somehow a thought
in the mind of each that possibly within its shelter
a camp or a house might be found.</p>
<p>The hour passed and all the efforts of the searching
boys were unrewarded. Not a trace of their
missing friends had they discovered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s plain
enough they aren&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; said George dejectedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; answered Grant, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve called
and shouted and whistled and looked and walked
and waited, but we haven&rsquo;t anything for all our
pains. I&rsquo;m beginning to believe the boys aren&rsquo;t
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you as far as this spot is concerned,&rdquo;
said George, &ldquo;but we ought to go on
farther down the island before we go back to Mackinac.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Grant. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back
to the motor-boat now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>Quickly the two boys started to return to the
place where the captain was awaiting their coming.
They had gone but a short distance, however, before
at George&rsquo;s suggestion they turned to their
left and moved toward a sandy stretch of shore
which they saw in the distance. &ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll
find a footprint the same as Robinson Crusoe
found on his island,&rdquo; suggested George striving to
speak lightly.</p>
<p>The suggestion was followed and great was the
surprise of both boys when they drew near the
winding sandy shore of a large cove to see swiftly
approaching from the south a motor-boat in the
distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look yonder!&rdquo; said Grant excitedly seizing his
friend by his shoulder as he spoke, and pointing in
the direction in which he had discovered the approaching
boat. &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t our boat, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered George positively after a brief
silence. &ldquo;Our boat is up the shore farther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Fred and John are on board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s something nobody knows. We&rsquo;ll soon
find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickening the pace at which they were walking
the two boys soon arrived at the place they were
seeking. Save for an occasional comment the silence
was unbroken while they both anxiously
watched the motor-boat which could be seen swiftly
approaching. Indeed the little boat was marvelously
swift and in a brief time the boys were
aware that there was only one person on board.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow is in a hurry anyway,&rdquo; suggested
Grant. &ldquo;Even if he doesn&rsquo;t know what he wants
he wants it right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment the sound of the footsteps of
some one in their rear startled both the young
watchers and as they glanced behind them they
discovered a man approaching. Apparently he
had come from the woods where they had begun
their search for their missing friends, but it was
quickly manifest that he was as startled by his
discovery of the presence of the boys as they had
been at his coming.</p>
<p>For a moment it seemed to both George and
Grant that the man was about to turn and flee from
the spot. However, apparently he thought better
and at once advanced toward the place where the
boys were standing.</p>
<p>At the same moment the boys looked again at
the approaching boat and to the surprise of both of
them they recognized the man at the wheel as the
one in whose house they had been received on
Cockburn Island several days before.</p>
<p>What the coming of the man implied neither of
the boys understood, but at that moment, however,
the man who had approached from the woods
shouted in his loudest tones to George and Grant.
Startled by the unexpected sound the two boys instantly
turned and fled quickly from the spot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br /><span class="small">SUSPICIOUS CHARACTERS</span></h2>
<p>So wearied were Fred and John by the exciting
experiences of the day that as soon as
they were left to themselves they were sound
asleep.</p>
<p>How long they had slept neither was aware when
at last both awoke. The little cabin was dark except
for a faint light streaming in through the
open porthole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we, Jack?&rdquo; called Fred in a low
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; replied John.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on board that boat that picked us up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I remember now. How are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right I guess, though I feel as if I had been
breaking stones or lifting weights all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you wouldn&rsquo;t feel that way if you really
had,&rdquo; responded Fred lightly. &ldquo;A fellow&rsquo;s muscles
would get used to the work if he had to do it
all the time. Where do you suppose we are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any idea. We&rsquo;re moving, though, all
the time, that&rsquo;s plain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can hear the swash of the water. I wonder
if we are anywhere near Mackinac Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go up and find out,&rdquo; suggested John and
hastily the boys left their bunk and made their way
to the deck.</p>
<p>The stars were shining and it was manifest to
the boys that the morning light had not yet appeared.</p>
<p>Perceiving a man near the stern of the boat they
at once approached him and made known their
presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; inquired Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be in Sault Ste. Marie in about a half an
hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, lad,&rdquo; said the sailor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did we pass Mackinac Island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mackinac Island! Why we left that a good
many hours ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you stop and put us off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t make any stop anywhere. I guess
the captain told you that we couldn&rsquo;t stop there.
That doesn&rsquo;t make any difference, however, we&rsquo;ll
be in Sault Ste. Marie pretty soon and then you
boys can stop all you want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How shall we get back to Mackinac?&rdquo; inquired
John.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; laughed the sailor, who appeared
to regard the plight of the boys more or less as a
joke. &ldquo;My suggestion would be to wait there and
when one of the line boats come through go back
on that. There will be one out somewhere about
noon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably that&rsquo;s the best we can do,&rdquo; said Fred
meekly. &ldquo;You say we&rsquo;ll be there in about a half
an hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys at once returned to their cabin, but to
their dismay they discovered that the clothes in
which they had been rescued were still too wet to
be donned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no help for it,&rdquo; said John disconsolately.
&ldquo;If this old tub stops long enough at Sault
Ste. Marie we can go ashore even in these togs we
have on. Come on back on deck and we&rsquo;ll find out
how long the stop is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning to the deck the boys learned that the
boat on which they were sailing was to remain six
hours at Sault Ste. Marie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Fred as he and John
withdrew to another part of the deck. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
go ashore just as we are and before the boat sails
we&rsquo;ll have a chance to change our clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were interested in spite of their predicament
in the low lying shores past which they
were steadily moving. It was sufficiently light to
enable them to mark several parks, evidently playgrounds
of the people of the little city which they
were approaching.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>True to the prophecy of the sailor the boat drew
alongside a dock within the half-hour. Again assuring
themselves that the vessel would not depart
within six hours, the boys at once leaped ashore
and started together up the wide street upon which
they now found themselves.</p>
<p>There were low buildings on each side and to
their surprise the boys were soon aware that many
people were moving about the street although it
was not yet three o&rsquo;clock in the morning. Among
these strangers they noticed numbers of Indians.
This fact, together with the decorations of many
of the buildings which were to be seen, indicated
that either a festival or a holiday of some kind
had been celebrated the preceding day, or that the
city was preparing for some event of importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t pay the captain anything for bringing
us up here,&rdquo; suggested John, as he and his
companion slowly walked up the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he
added hastily, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a cent of money in my
pocket, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in these pockets,&rdquo; laughed John, whose
spirits now had returned. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to go
back and get some money if we are going to get
any breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t any money in my other pockets,&rdquo;
said Fred ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I haven&rsquo;t either,&rdquo; added John laughing as
he spoke. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think we would want any
money yesterday so I didn&rsquo;t take any with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother would say that this is another
good lesson. She says I am all the while out of
money and I ought to have enough with me to provide
for what I want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the difficulty,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so
much getting the money as it is keeping it. But
this is no joke, Fred. Neither of us has any money
and I don&rsquo;t believe up here even at Sault Ste. Marie
they will give us something to eat unless we pay
for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put my watch in my pocket,&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t see anything for us to do except to hock
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe some fellow that keeps a restaurant will
take it as security and hold it until we can redeem
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try that,&rdquo; said Fred quickly. &ldquo;I wish
we could find some place open now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we can, there are so many people on
the street,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;Come on let&rsquo;s go further
on and try it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>In accordance with John&rsquo;s suggestion the boys
walked rapidly up the street and soon to their delight
they discovered a restaurant which evidently
was being patronized at that early hour. Several
people could be seen seated at the small tables
within the room, and, encouraged by the sight, the
boys at once entered.</p>
<p>At the cashier&rsquo;s desk a woman was seated, but
evidently she had been there throughout the night.
There were moments when her head nodded and
she plainly was greatly in need of sleep.</p>
<p>At once approaching her Fred said, &ldquo;We have
been unfortunate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re not the only ones,&rdquo; said the
woman sitting quickly erect as she heard the unexpected
statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; laughed Fred, &ldquo;but we
fell into the lake and were picked up by a boat that
did not stop until it got to Sault Ste. Marie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you want it to stop?&rdquo; inquired the
woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mackinac Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you working there?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Working?&rdquo; laughed Fred. &ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t
working at all. We were staying at one of the
hotels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the woman glanced quickly at the
young spokesman and then shaking her head began
to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; demanded Fred
irritated by her manner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you had the parlor suit,&rdquo; said the
woman still laughing at the boys before her.
&ldquo;You look as if you belong to John Jacob Astor&rsquo;s
family. It may be that you look better than he
did when he used to come there, but I guess you
wouldn&rsquo;t pass for much more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time the boys were aware that the
strange garb in which they were clad certainly did
not imply that they had been guests at any prominent
summer hotel. Both suits were ill-fitting
and worn, and if either had been plunged in soap
and water within a year there was nothing in the
garments to imply such action.</p>
<p>For a moment Fred was nonplussed and then
hastily thrusting his hand into his pocket he drew
forth his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will that do?&rdquo; he said as he placed the
gold watch on the desk. It was a beautiful little
time-piece, a present he had received on his sixteenth
birthday from his father. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take
that as security, I guess,&rdquo; he said lightly, &ldquo;and
when we get back to Mackinac Island we&rsquo;ll send
you the money or come with it and get the watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Picking up the time-piece the woman gazed curiously
at it and then again looking sharply at the
boys she said, &ldquo;Where did you get that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a present,&rdquo; said Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who gave it to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he live on Fifth Avenue, New York?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He does not,&rdquo; said Fred slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I thought maybe he did,&rdquo; sniffed the
woman. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind of watches they have in
New York City. It isn&rsquo;t the kind that most of the
roustabouts carry on the lakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not a roustabout,&rdquo; said Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to say what you are,&rdquo; said the
woman. &ldquo;All I can say is that I shan&rsquo;t take that
watch. I don&rsquo;t want the police in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Police!&rdquo; exclaimed Fred. &ldquo;What do you
mean? What would the police come for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For one thing they would come for the watch
and another thing they would want would be the
fellow that took it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you think I stole that watch?&rdquo; demanded
Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying nothing,&rdquo; said the woman.
&ldquo;All I say is that if any boys on the lake are seen
carrying watches like that it is most generally
known how they got them. My advice to you is to
stick that watch in your pocket again and don&rsquo;t let
anybody see it while you&rsquo;re in Sault Ste. Marie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t trouble yourself any more,&rdquo; said
Fred as he took the watch and thrust it again into
his pocket. Then turning to John he said, &ldquo;Come
on, Jack, we won&rsquo;t stay here another minute.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>When the boys were once more on the street
Fred&rsquo;s indignation soon gave way to a feeling of
alarm. Not only were they without any means of
securing breakfast, to say nothing of their passage
back to Mackinac Island, but also they might be
regarded as suspicious characters. Evidently the
woman keeper of the restaurant had believed they
had stolen the watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Fred,&rdquo; suggested John. &ldquo;It will
all come out right. We&rsquo;ll try it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might pawn the watch,&rdquo; said Fred thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no pawn shop open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there probably will be a little later.
There must be a good many such shops in a place
like this. I&rsquo;m getting hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; said John fervently, &ldquo;but that
doesn&rsquo;t do me any good. There&rsquo;s another restaurant
down yonder,&rdquo; he added quickly, pointing
down the street as he spoke. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost light
now and we might try it there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not very hopeful,
but they can&rsquo;t do any more than throw us out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless they arrest us as suspicious characters,&rdquo;
suggested John somewhat ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never know until we try anyway,&rdquo; said
Fred resolutely. &ldquo;Come on, Jack, we&rsquo;ll soon
know what is going to happen to us. If we get
into jail we&rsquo;ll have to telegraph the boys to bail
us out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t know where the fellows are,&rdquo; declared
John.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as sure as you live. I had almost forgotten
about that. We certainly are having our
troubles on this trip, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the boys had stopped in front of
the restaurant they were seeking and at once entering
they looked quickly about the room for the
proprietor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br /><span class="small">PENNILESS</span></h2>
<p>At once advancing toward the man whom
they discovered walking about the room
Fred said quietly, &ldquo;My friend and I are
in trouble. We were out in a skiff yesterday and
the little boat got to leaking so badly that we both
of us had to stay in the water. We were there a
half-day, and then we were picked up by a boat
which did not stop at Mackinac Island and brought
us straight through to Sault Ste. Marie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you?&rdquo; inquired the man suspiciously
as he glanced keenly at Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were staying at Mackinac Island, but had
gone over across to one of the islands on the Canadian
shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you doing there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking for our friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we were trying to find out,&rdquo; said
Fred ruefully. &ldquo;There were two other fellows
with us and they got lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you want me to give you some breakfast,
is that it?&rdquo; said the proprietor abruptly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t want you to &lsquo;give&rsquo; us anything,&rdquo;
retorted Fred. &ldquo;I have got my watch here and I
thought perhaps if I left it as security you would
let us have some breakfast. We&rsquo;ll send you the
money just as soon as we can go back to Mackinac.
These clothes we have on,&rdquo; he added as he
perceived that the man was closely regarding their
outfit, &ldquo;were given us by the sailors that rescued
us. We have got some different clothes down at
the dock, but they were soaked through and so
some of the crew fixed us up as well as they could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What boat did you come on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Fred, &ldquo;it was almost dark
and we weren&rsquo;t thinking about the name, we were
so anxious to be taken on board. After we had
been in the water as long as we were we didn&rsquo;t stop
for little things like that. Will you take the watch
and let us have some breakfast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Extending his hand the man took the watch and
then examined it with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good watch,&rdquo; he said after a brief
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;My father gave
it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure that&rsquo;s the way you got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you the truth,&rdquo; said Fred seriously.
He was in no mood now to resent any implications
as to the method by which the watch had come into
his possession. The odor of breakfast was strong
in the room and the appetites of both boys were so
keen that other things were ignored.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll take your watch,&rdquo; said the man.
&ldquo;You give me your name and address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as these had been given the boys seated
themselves at one of the tables and in a brief time
were served with a simple breakfast. It was
marvelous, however, the amount of food which was
eaten by the hungry lads. It had been a long
time since they had tasted anything of the kind
and even the proprietor laughed as he saw the
simple breakfast disappear.</p>
<p>At last, when the boys could eat no more and
they were preparing to depart, the proprietor said,
&ldquo;Did you tell me that you were staying at Mackinac
Island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At one of the hotels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then my advice to you is to telegraph there for
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that,&rdquo; said Fred quickly.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very thing we&rsquo;ll do. Come on, Jack,&rdquo;
he added, turning to his companion. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go to
the telegraph office right away. Will you tell us
where it is, please?&rdquo; he asked of the restaurant
keeper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>Stepping outside his door the proprietor pointed
to the office and after they had thanked him for
his kindness John and Fred at once started for the
place.</p>
<p>Their troubles, however, were not ended, for
again they found their appearance decidedly
against them. The telegraph operator refused to
take any message that should be paid for at Mackinac.
He also refused to listen to any of their explanations
and in response to the appeals of the
boys explained that he had to be governed by the
rules of the office.</p>
<p>Even with all their protests and pleadings the
boys were unable to induce the operator to change
his decision. He still refused to accept the message
and as the boys were without money it was
impossible for them to prepay it.</p>
<p>Fred and John when they withdrew from the
telegraph office were not so disconsolate as they
had been when they had met their first rebuff.
The ample breakfast they had secured had done
much to bring back their courage and again they
were Go Ahead Boys in earnest.</p>
<p>On the sidewalk the two boys stopped once more
to think over their difficult condition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do now?&rdquo; asked John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody can ask questions,&rdquo; laughed Fred.
&ldquo;If I could answer it I would be very glad to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you anything to suggest?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Fred quickly as a sudden inspiration
came to him, &ldquo;it can&rsquo;t be very far from
here to Mackinac Island. Suppose we go back to
the dock and see if we can&rsquo;t arrange for our passage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will meet us with great enthusiasm,&rdquo;
said John laughing slightly as he spoke. &ldquo;Probably
they&rsquo;ll hail us as the very fellows they have
been waiting for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we won&rsquo;t look so much like tramps when
we get our other clothes on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; assented John, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll have
to find that out later. Come on back and we&rsquo;ll
see what we can do now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the boys returned to the dock their anger
was almost as great as their surprise when they
discovered that the boat in which they had come
had resumed its voyage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they said,&rdquo; declared Fred bitterly, &ldquo;that
they were going to hang up here six hours. They
have gone in less than three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they are paid for our passage anyway.
They have got two suits of clothes and that&rsquo;s something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is that,&rdquo; said Fred smiling ruefully as he
spoke. &ldquo;Just now I think it&rsquo;s a good deal. When
I look at the things you have on, Jack, and then
think of that beautiful suit sailing away over Lake
Superior, I&rsquo;m almost ready to weep!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t affect
me that way. When I see you as you are now
and then think of you as I have seen you all dolled
up and even your shoes polished, to say nothing
of that red necktie you wear so frequently, I don&rsquo;t
feel like weeping, I feel like yelling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make any difference,&rdquo; said Fred.
&ldquo;Our boat&rsquo;s gone. Now what is the best thing
for us to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To go ahead,&rdquo; said John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on then,&rdquo; said Fred briskly.</p>
<p>Together the two boys made inquiries at various
places, but did not discover any boats leaving in
the near future that would land them at the place
they were seeking. After several inquiries they
were directed to the office of the great steamboats,
which made the long voyage from Buffalo to
Duluth and return. The appearance of the boys,
however, was so markedly against them that they
were unsuccessful in arranging for their passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if the Go Ahead Boys had gotten to
the end of their journey,&rdquo; said John when the
boys once more were on the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe that for a minute,&rdquo; said
Fred. &ldquo;The only time it is necessary for a man
to show that he has any grit is when he is in
trouble. If there weren&rsquo;t any hard things to be
done there wouldn&rsquo;t be any need of a fellow bracing
up to do them. If everything was smooth and
easy all the time everybody would get along. It&rsquo;s
just because the way is a little hard that there&rsquo;s
need for us to go ahead. We&rsquo;ll find a way yet,
Jack. Come on back to the dock.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>Neither boy was disheartened when after three
or four more attempts to arrange for a passage
they found even their strongest pleadings without
avail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re simply up against it,&rdquo; said John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s the time to go ahead,&rdquo; declared
Fred. &ldquo;Come on and we&rsquo;ll try that fellow yonder.&rdquo;
As he spoke he pointed toward a motor-boat
at the lower end of the dock on which the
boys were standing. The boat was old and
greatly in need of paint. A disconsolate appearing
individual whom the boys suspected to be
the owner, manager, chief stockholder and captain
of the little craft sat on the dock swinging his
long legs over the water.</p>
<p>The boys were able to see that the man had
bright red hair and that his face was covered with
huge freckles or splotches of a dark, reddish brown
hue. He was apparently about thirty years of
age, long, ungainly and awkward in his every action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go see him,&rdquo; suggested Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look as if he knew enough to run
a boat even to the bottom,&rdquo; responded John,
nevertheless joining his friend as they advanced
toward the man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t expect the most intellectual individual
in the world to be running a tub like that,
did you?&rdquo; demanded Fred, as they came nearer
and obtained a closer view of the peculiar individual.
&ldquo;If he knew more he wouldn&rsquo;t be around
here in a worn-out old tub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; laughed John, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave the interview
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see that you have come to your
senses at last,&rdquo; declared Fred soberly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
good thing sometimes to know that you don&rsquo;t
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; retorted John, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s better
yet not to know so many things that aren&rsquo;t
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just listen,&rdquo; said Fred, as he turned toward
the stranger who had glanced at the approaching
boys and then resumed his former position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; called Fred cheerily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey?&rdquo; answered the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said good morning,&rdquo; repeated Fred striving
to speak cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t noticed. Is it?&rdquo; said the man glancing
toward the sky as he spoke. &ldquo;Most of these
mornings up here have been foggy. We have had
the worst weather this summer I ever see. Seems
to get worse all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that Ruskin says there isn&rsquo;t
any bad weather? There are just different kinds
of good weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruskin, who&rsquo;s he? I never heard tell o&rsquo; him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t live here at the Sault,&rdquo; acknowledged
Fred. &ldquo;Never mind the weather. What
I want to know is can you take us in your motor-boat
to Mackinac Island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I can,&rdquo; said the man whose little reddish
brown eyes narrowed as he gazed shrewdly at
the boys as he spoke. &ldquo;Depends on whether you
got the price or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much will you charge to take us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll charge ten dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll pay it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you pay it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pay you just as soon
as you land us at Mackinac.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know you will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have our word for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look neither one of you as if that
was too much of a load for you to carry alone.&rdquo;
The man&rsquo;s voice was nasal and high, and he did
not smile while he was speaking. The boys were
unable to decide whether he was serious or was
speaking lightly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s clothes you want,&rdquo; said Fred, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
show you some better ones just as soon as we get
up to the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;I
guess I&rsquo;m a fool for my pains, but I got to go
around by Cockburn Island. If you want to go
aboard and go with me I&rsquo;ll fetch you around to
Mackinac for ten dollars. I know I&rsquo;m taking a
big chance, but maybe you be too. What do you
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say go ahead,&rdquo; answered Fred quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI
<br /><span class="small">A VAGUE HINT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead it is,&rdquo; responded the skipper.
&ldquo;I can be ready in five minutes. Can
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re ready now,&rdquo; said John quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know how it is,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Most
always the passengers, if they want anything to
eat on the way, put it on board before we start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we cannot get anything to eat,&rdquo; said
Fred. &ldquo;We told you why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you did. So you did,&rdquo; said the captain
again speaking in his high nasal tones. &ldquo;Still I
guess we&rsquo;ll be hungry before night. Maybe I can
find something. You boys wait here until I go up
the street and I&rsquo;ll be back in a few minutes.&rdquo;
When he had thus spoken the ungainly man took a
basket on his arm and at once set forth on his
errand.</p>
<p>Left to themselves the boys went on board the
strange craft and the hasty inspection they made
did not increase their confidence either in the boat
or in its owner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about the only way there is,&rdquo; said John
at last, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ve got to take it. It&rsquo;s Hobson&rsquo;s
choice. We can&rsquo;t stay here and we can&rsquo;t get passage
on the big boats so we&rsquo;ll have to put up with
what we can get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next week,&rdquo; said Fred lightly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll all be
laughing about it. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind this adventure
at all if I was sure Grant and George are all
right. Every time I think of them I&rsquo;m worried
when I remember what you and I went through.
If that boat hadn&rsquo;t come along just as it did we
might be at the bottom of Lake Huron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we are not there,&rdquo; said John quickly.
&ldquo;The fact is we are here and we wish we weren&rsquo;t.
If the other fellows were along with us I would
like to go out yonder and shoot those rapids,&rdquo; he
said pointing toward the swift rapids that were
not far away. Even while he was speaking a skiff,
guided by an Indian, came swiftly through the
tossing waters and approached the shore not far
from the place where the boys were seated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; joined in Fred heartily. &ldquo;I
have a good mind to try it as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ll have to wait until you get your
fortune changed so that you can pay a man a half-dollar
for letting you shoot the rapids in his skiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, of course,&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;I never
realized before what a convenience it is to have
some change in your pocket. Never again will I
go out for a day&rsquo;s trip, no matter where it is, without
having something in my purse.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You mean as long as your father or some one
else puts it in your purse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t mean anything of the kind,&rdquo; retorted
Fred. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose I am always going
to be dependent, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought very much about it,&rdquo; laughed
John. &ldquo;If you want my opinion, it is that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever John&rsquo;s judgment might be it was not
expressed at the time for at that moment the tall
skipper was seen returning to the dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I got enough to stay our stomachs a little
while,&rdquo; said the captain as he swung the basket
from his arm and deposited it under one of the
seats in the motor-boat. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the best kind
and what such stylish young gentlemen as you be
are used to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was plain to both boys that the skipper had
not taken their explanations seriously and that he
still was doubtful as to their real purpose. However,
he did not refer to his suspicions and in a
brief time he had the motor-boat ready to set
forth on its long voyage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>For a brief time after the boys departed from
Sault Ste. Marie their interest in the sights along
the nearby shores was so keen that their own
plight in a measure was forgotten. Several times
the little boat was tossed by the waves that were
upturned by the passage of some large freight
boat. Occasionally they were hailed by people
on board, for in the summer-time many of these
freight boats carried a few passengers, making a
delightful trip through the great lakes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; said the skipper, at last turning to
the boys, &ldquo;that the best way for me to do will be
to go down through St. Mary&rsquo;s River and then
strike into the North Channel. I&rsquo;ll keep close to
the shore of Drummond Island and then I&rsquo;ll come
around to Cockburn Island that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your tub,&mdash;I mean your motor-boat,&rdquo; said
Fred correcting himself quickly, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t seem to
be making very fast time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fast enough,&rdquo; said the skipper quietly.
&ldquo;Time ain&rsquo;t much use to me. Some folks say time
is money. If I had as much money as I had time
I wouldn&rsquo;t be carrying two young sprints like you
down through Mud Lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long do you think you&rsquo;ll be before we
land at Mackinac Island?&rdquo; inquired Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not knowing, I can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; replied the captain.
&ldquo;My general feeling is that if we make it
by day after to-morrow we&rsquo;ll be doing mighty
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded John blankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean just what I say. I&rsquo;m not going to
drive my boat very hard and by the time we have
gone down St. Mary&rsquo;s River and into the North
Channel and then around to Cockburn Island it
will be some time before we can start for Mackinac.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But where will we stay nights?&rdquo; inquired
Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pick out a good place somewhere. I have
got a canvas that stretches over the boat and will
keep out the wind and we can crawl under that
when it gets dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t enough for us to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; said the skipper dryly. &ldquo;That
depends I guess a little on how much you want to
eat. I have got some salt pork and potatoes and
if you don&rsquo;t like that diet all I can say is that you
might have brought your own stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were silent as the reference to their
poverty caused them both to realize how impossible
it was for them to obtain even the common
necessities of life, if they had no money with which
to make their purchases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever been over to Cockburn Island?&rdquo; inquired
the captain after a long silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a funny island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so funny as the people on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought,&rdquo; laughed Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you weren&rsquo;t thinking far wrong. I&rsquo;ve
been over to Cockburn Island every month ever
since the ice went out of the lakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you go for?&rdquo; asked John.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t tell you then you won&rsquo;t know, will
you?&rdquo; said the captain glancing shrewdly at the
boys as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose we shall,&rdquo; acknowledged John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind tellin&rsquo; you that I don&rsquo;t expect
to go there many times more. I&rsquo;m going to get
even with that man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Halsey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the man that stays summers on Cockburn
Island. Leastwise he stays there part of the
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he the man that has the little house that
looks like an old shanty about a quarter of a mile
back from the shore? Does he have a Japanese
servant and is there a little barn back of the
shanty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about that barn?&rdquo; demanded
the skipper turning abruptly about and
staring at the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know anything about it. I&rsquo;m just
telling you about the place and asking you if Mr.
Halsey is the name of the man who lives there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re all correct,&rdquo; said the captain.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s his name and I guess that&rsquo;s the place
where he lives. He&rsquo;s the man I was tellin&rsquo; you
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one who employs you?&rdquo; inquired John.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether he employs me or not.
I work for him. He has got to live up to his
promises better than he has though, or I&rsquo;ll put him
where he won&rsquo;t do quite so much business as he
has been doin&rsquo; this summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is his business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish you knew?&rdquo; said the skipper.
There was an expression in his eyes that indicated
that the man was deficient. Indeed, Fred whispered
to John, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe the fellow is all
there. I guess if you knocked on his head you&rsquo;d
find nobody home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly looks the part,&rdquo; agreed John,
&ldquo;but I want to find out more about Mr. Halsey, as
he calls him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell us what business Mr. Halsey
is engaged in,&rdquo; added John as he turned once
more to the skipper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I didn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s the question a
good many folks would like to have answered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he have any business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Business! Business!&rdquo; exclaimed the skipper.
He had previously explained that his name was
Rufus Blodgett and that he was commonly called
Rufe by his passengers and friends. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t
work more than twelve hours a day, let me tell you,
and he gets better pay than anybody around these
diggins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And nobody knows what his business is?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Rufe, slyly winking as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s tellin&rsquo;. Maybe somebody will know
pretty soon. At least I have wrote some letters
that will be likely to put somebody on his track
that he won&rsquo;t like very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you write those letters to Mr. Button?&rdquo;
demanded Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about any letters?&rdquo; said
Rufe, his voice becoming very low as he spoke and
the glitter again appearing in his narrow little
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw them,&rdquo; said Fred more boldly. &ldquo;We
mean the one that you signed &lsquo;American
Brother.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who showed it to you?&rdquo; said Rufe. &ldquo;Beats
all, I never supposed two such youngsters as you
knew anything about them letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you write them for?&rdquo; asked John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you this Mr. Halsey is makin&rsquo; all
kinds of money? He agreed to divide with me
and he hasn&rsquo;t done it. I told him I would get even
with him and you see if I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he is a smuggler, is he?&rdquo; inquired John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better take my advice and not say
that word very often around in these parts. I
guess there ain&rsquo;t any harm in a man buying somethin&rsquo;
on one side o&rsquo; the lake and sellin&rsquo; it on the
other.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s a law against it,&rdquo; suggested Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; but a man-made law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has that got to do with it?&rdquo; asked John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care nothin&rsquo; about man-made laws. I
don&rsquo;t find nothin&rsquo; in the Bible that says I mustn&rsquo;t
smuggle, as you call it. Mind you, I ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo;
I&rsquo;m no smuggler, I&rsquo;m just talkin&rsquo; on general principles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have not told us what Mr. Halsey
smuggles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; t&rsquo; tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what you&rsquo;re going to Cockburn Island
now for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish you knew?&rdquo; said Rufe, laughing
as if he considered his question to be a good
joke. &ldquo;Did you say,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that you
had ever been out in the barn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We said we hadn&rsquo;t been there,&rdquo; replied Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a mighty good reason why you didn&rsquo;t
go, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That there watch dog o&rsquo; the Halseys. There
was a fellow here once what was tellin&rsquo; about some
dog that a man named Pluto kept. He said that
dog had three heads and they all barked at the
same time and all bit together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he tell you where Mr. Pluto lived?&rdquo; asked
Fred soberly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Rufe. &ldquo;Where does he
live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very far from Cockburn Island, you&rsquo;ll
find if you don&rsquo;t quit breaking the laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were many conversations during the voyage
similar to those which have been recorded, and
the boys became more convinced that the strange
skipper undoubtedly in some way was sharing in
the experiences of the man whom they had met on
Cockburn Island and whose name Rufe declared
to be Halsey.</p>
<p>The little motor-boat stopped for a time on the
shore of Mud Lake.</p>
<p>There the skipper cooked some of the potatoes
and salt pork he had brought with him and the
boys declared that never had they tasted food more
delicious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII
<br /><span class="small">A PASSENGER FOR COCKBURN ISLAND</span></h2>
<p>Neither George nor Grant was aware of
the reason for their abrupt flight when
the shout of the approaching man was
heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; called George to Grant after the
boys had gone a hundred yards or more. &ldquo;What
fools we are. What are we running for anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we want to get somewhere. We
don&rsquo;t know just where it is but we&rsquo;re in a hurry to
get there, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke Grant glanced toward the woods in
the distance from which the man that had hailed
them had unexpectedly come. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid.
Come on, let&rsquo;s go back to the motor-boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find them?&rdquo; inquired the captain when
the boys approached the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look so tuckered out, both of you, that I
thought maybe you saw them somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we didn&rsquo;t find them,&rdquo; said Grant, &ldquo;but we
saw&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>The boy stopped as if he hesitated to refer to
the fact that they had fled from a man who had
unexpectedly hailed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saw what?&rdquo; said the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know who lives on Cockburn Island?&rdquo;
abruptly asked George.</p>
<p>For a moment the captain made no reply as he
looked keenly at the boys. At last he said, &ldquo;I have
sailed over to Cockburn Island a good many times.
Why do you want to know who lives there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had some strange experiences on that
island,&rdquo; explained Grant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt you,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
doubt your word a bit. What did you see there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it wasn&rsquo;t so much what we saw as the
fact that there seemed to be something very mysterious
about the island and the people who live
there. We went into a little shanty one day. At
least it looked like a little shanty, not very far back
from the shore and we found it all fitted up like a
city house. There were rugs on the floors, and
chairs and tables just such as you might see in
town. The man had a Japanese servant, but there
was something so strange about the whole thing
that we didn&rsquo;t know just what to make of it. Do
you know the man who lives there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen him,&rdquo; said the captain simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anything queer about him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>The captain whistled as he looked up into the
sky as if he was searching the clouds for an answer.
&ldquo;I know him when I see him,&rdquo; he said at last. A
moment later he added, &ldquo;I guess I see him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Startled by his words the boys looked quickly in
the direction indicated, and across the field saw two
men approaching the shore. One plainly was the
man whom they had seen on Cockburn Island and
his companion was the one who had approached
from the woods and at his unexpected and startling
hail the boys had fled up the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose they want?&rdquo; said
George in a low voice to Grant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the remotest idea. If we stay here
a little while we may know more about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not a word was spoken while the boys and the
captain waited for the two men to approach. It
was plain that they were walking toward the place
where the motor-boat was anchored, although what
their errand was neither of the boys understood.</p>
<p>At the same time George felt of the letter in his
pocket. The strange epistle had not only puzzled
the boys but somehow they were unable to free
themselves from the thought that it was directly
connected in some way with the approaching man.</p>
<p>At that moment George pulled the sleeve of his
friend and excitedly pointed toward the lake. Not
far from the shore a swift little motor-boat was
passing and when George whispered, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
little Jap at the wheel, I&rsquo;m sure it is,&rdquo; the excitement
of both boys became more intense.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>Abruptly the two men who had been approaching
when they discovered that the boys were not
alone, turned and walked along the shore in the
direction in which the motor-boat, driven by the
Japanese, was moving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed Grant &ldquo;We had our run
for nothing. Those men didn&rsquo;t want us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you are so well informed,&rdquo; said
George, still watching the departing men as long
as they could be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; said their captain, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s about
time for us to start on. If we are going to find
your friends we have got to get busy or we shan&rsquo;t
get back to Mackinac Island to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words at once were heeded and the search
for the missing boys was quickly renewed.</p>
<p>George and Grant walked along the shore maintaining
a careful outlook for their friends, or for
any signs that would indicate that they had been
there not long before. Occasionally the boys advanced
into the island, but in every case they returned
without having discovered any traces of
their missing companions. In this way much of
the afternoon passed and the sun was sinking
lower in the western sky when the captain said,
&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much use in trying any longer, boys.
We must be starting back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>Both George and Grant were depressed now
for they had been working busily throughout most
of the day and all their efforts had been unavailing.
The missing boys had not been found nor had anything
been discovered to indicate that their friends
had even landed on Western Duck Island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will be all right,&rdquo; said the captain, striving
to cheer up his downhearted young companions.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll take care of themselves. There hasn&rsquo;t
been any storm and two boys in such weather can&rsquo;t
get into trouble on Lake Huron unless they try
to and you say they aren&rsquo;t that kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said George quickly. &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t
be looking for trouble, but trouble may have been
looking for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess not,&rdquo; laughed the captain. &ldquo;Most
likely when we get back to Mackinac you&rsquo;ll find
they are already there or else have chartered another
motor-boat to go out and look for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the boys were about to take their places on
board the little craft they were surprised when
they heard a hail from some one who was approaching
from the woods.</p>
<p>In a brief time it was manifest that the man
whom they had seen on Cockburn Island was the
one who was now before them and that he was
earnest in his request for them not to depart before
he joined them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to leave now?&rdquo; inquired the man
when at last he stood beside the boys who were
ready to embark on the little skiff and row out to
the motor-boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Grant quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am wondering if you&rsquo;ll be willing to take me
on board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, I&rsquo;m willing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess the captain wouldn&rsquo;t object if I agreed
to pay him. How about it?&rdquo; added the new passenger,
turning to the captain as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys have chartered the boat,&rdquo; said the
captain, &ldquo;and I haven&rsquo;t anything to say about it.
They&rsquo;ll have to decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to go to Mackinac?&rdquo; inquired
Grant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the man. &ldquo;I want to stop at
Cockburn Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s out of our course,&rdquo; said the captain
quickly. &ldquo;We shall cut right across to Mackinac.
In weather like this we&rsquo;re as safe as we would be
on a mill-pond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay you well for my passage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much longer will it take?&rdquo; inquired
George turning to the captain as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t get back to Mackinac before eleven
o&rsquo;clock if you go by Cockburn Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very important,&rdquo; broke in the man. &ldquo;I
ought to be there now. I&rsquo;ll pay you ten dollars if
you&rsquo;ll take me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said George, after he glanced questioningly
at his companion.</p>
<p>Without delaying, the man at once stepped on
board the skiff and in a few minutes all three were
on board of the motor-boat.</p>
<p>There was no delay now and the swift little boat
was soon leaving Western Duck Island behind it.</p>
<p>Somehow the mystery in which the boys had
found themselves involved during the past few
days instead of becoming clearer was darker than
before. Who was their passenger? Why was he
so desirous of being carried to Cockburn Island?
These questions and many others were discussed
in low tones by George and Grant while their passenger
remained seated in the bow of the swiftly
moving little motor-boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of calm,&rdquo; said the captain breaking
in upon the prolonged silence on board, &ldquo;I knew a
man once that was held up three days on one of
these islands by a storm. &rsquo;Twas a regular no&rsquo;-easter
and blew a gale without stopping. This
man I&rsquo;m telling you about managed to get ashore
on one of the islands and couldn&rsquo;t leave until the
storm passed and he was picked up by some boat.
So you see you needn&rsquo;t get so down-hearted about
your friends. Something may have happened to
their boat or they may have landed somewhere and
maybe they didn&rsquo;t pull their skiff far enough up on
the shore. There&rsquo;s a hundred things I can think
of to comfort your hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good of you,&rdquo; said Grant &ldquo;I wish I
felt about it the way you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was dusk when at last the motor-boat drew
near the familiar shores of Cockburn Island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some boat&rsquo;s ahead of you,&rdquo; called the captain.
&ldquo;See, there&rsquo;s a motor-boat already there at that
little landing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The attention not only of the boys but of their
other passenger was at once called to the boat in
the distance. And it was apparent too that the
man was greatly excited by the discovery.</p>
<p>As the boys came nearer they both were convinced
that they had never seen the boat before.
They were able to see that it had been long since
it had been painted and its general air of dilapidation
was so manifest that under other circumstances
the boys would have laughed at its appearance.</p>
<p>Occasionally they glanced at the man on board
whose surprise and excitement or alarm at the discovery
of the presence of the other motor-boat had
now become more marked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look yonder!&rdquo; said Grant at last when they
were within a few yards of the landing place.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s somebody coming from the house.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>Both boys were silent for a brief time as they
watched the approaching men. One of them was
tall and ungainly and had a strange swinging motion
as he walked across the fields. Beside him
were two boys.</p>
<p>George suddenly grasped his friend by the arm
and in a low voice said, &ldquo;Do you know who those
fellows are?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><span class="small">AN UNEXPECTED MEETING</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;They look like Fred and John,&rdquo; replied
Grant in a whisper. &ldquo;Where do you
suppose they came from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care where they came from, the most I
want to know is that they are here. You don&rsquo;t
suppose they are ghosts, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you would find out whether they were
ghosts or not if you tried to throw Fred. Come
on, let&rsquo;s go ahead and meet them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Advancing quickly the boys soon drew near the
place where the approaching forms were seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fred, is that you?&rdquo; called George anxiously.</p>
<p>Instantly the trio stopped and in amazement
stared in the direction from which the unexpected
hail had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Fred? Is that you, Jack?&rdquo;
George called again, this time speaking a little
more loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied John. &ldquo;Who is it calling us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been gone so long you don&rsquo;t recognize
your own friend,&rdquo; called back George.
&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the same question we might ask you,&rdquo;
retorted Fred. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t expect to find you
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither did we expect to find you,&rdquo; said
George. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re mighty glad we have though,
for we have been looking for you a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble is you didn&rsquo;t look in the right
place,&rdquo; laughed Fred, who was delighted to be with
his friends once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to tell us that,&rdquo; retorted Grant.
&ldquo;We have had troubles enough of our own without
having you twit us about them. We looked all
around Western Duck Island and up and down the
shore but couldn&rsquo;t find any trace of you. Now
tell us where you have been and what you have
been doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All six were now returning to the shore together,
the strange companion of Fred and John walking
in advance of the boys. Several times George
nudged Fred as he pointed toward the ungainly
figure which was somewhat dim in the obscure
light. The peculiar gait, the strange swinging
motion of the shoulders were not to be forgotten
when once they had been seen. Rufus, however,
had not spoken since the meeting of the boys and
because of that fact there were still further revelations
to be made that were to startle the newcomers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get here, Fred?&rdquo; demanded
George unable longer to restrain his curiosity when
the boys were within a few yards of the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came in a motor-boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sault St. Marie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be honest, Fred. This is no time for joking.
Where did you come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not joking and I&rsquo;m telling you the truth.
We started from Sault St. Marie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you been here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About two hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you come to Cockburn Island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because our skipper said he had to come here
before he could take us to Mackinac.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he want to come here for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk any more now,&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;Wait
until we get back and we&rsquo;ll tell you all about it and
there are some things worth hearing, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the boys and the strange skipper returned
to the shore and it was discovered that there were
two motor-boats there, John quickly said to Rufus,
&ldquo;Our friends are going back to Mackinac and we
can go with them so you won&rsquo;t have to go out of
your course. You can go right back to Sault St.
Marie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about them ten dollars?&rdquo; demanded
Rufus, speaking in his shrillest tones. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
intend to let go of you until I see the color of them
dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got any money with you?&rdquo; demanded
Fred, turning quickly to George and Grant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much do you want?&rdquo; inquired George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten dollars. That&rsquo;s what we agreed to pay
our skipper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we can make that up between us,&rdquo; said
Grant, and in a brief time the money was produced
and the brilliant-hued Rufus was paid. With
evident satisfaction, he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, boys,
but I shall stay over here to Cockburn Island for
three or four days. If you show up again in these
parts you might let me know and maybe I can do
somethin&rsquo; more for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; laughed Fred. &ldquo;You certainly
have helped us out of our troubles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he help you out of your clothes, too?&rdquo; demanded
Grant, who now had become aware for the
first time of the strange garb in which both his
friends were clad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we picked them up on the lake-boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the steamer. We weren&rsquo;t proud. We
didn&rsquo;t want the crew to think that we felt above
them so we put on the suits that they provided us
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They certainly picked out choice ones,&rdquo;
laughed George, as he grasped the sleeve of Fred&rsquo;s
coat. &ldquo;When are you going to start for Mackinac?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s become of our friend whose house is on
the island here?&rdquo; inquired Grant in a low voice.</p>
<p>So interested had they all been in the recent experiences
that the passenger they had brought with
them had been forgotten.</p>
<p>When the boys looked quickly about them they
were aware that the man had disappeared. However,
as he had landed and their duty was done they
were all ready now for the return to Mackinac
Island, where they could not expect to arrive before
two or three o&rsquo;clock the following morning.</p>
<p>The ungainly Rufus was again thanked for his
aid and then the four boys speedily took their
places on board the little motor-boat in which the
searching party had set forth early that morning.</p>
<p>After the boat had left the shores of Cockburn
Island behind them, so eager were George and
Grant to learn what had befallen their friends that
they insisted that the entire story should be told
them.</p>
<p>And what a strange story it was. Fred or John,
alternately breaking in upon each other, each insisting
upon describing the perilous adventures
through which they had passed, finally related the
story of their rescue and the strange manner in
which they had been taken to Sault St. Marie.
Stranger still was the story they had to tell of their
return and the reason why they had been found on
Cockburn Island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But that isn&rsquo;t the strangest part of all,&rdquo; explained
Fred when the first of their story had
been told. &ldquo;We have something else worth telling
and when you hear it you&rsquo;ll both sit up and
listen to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; inquired George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man Rufus who took us in his motor-boat
over to Cockburn Island is a queer Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised to hear you say that,&rdquo; laughed
George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His clothes and his voice, to say nothing of his
hair and his long legs, are a small part when you
stop to think of some other things,&rdquo; said John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What other things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now listen and we&rsquo;ll tell you. We&rsquo;ve about decided
that the man who stays on Cockburn Island
is a regular smuggler. You know those letters we
found, or rather the letter that came to me and the
one we picked up on the shore of Western Duck
Island, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied George and Grant together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suspect,&rdquo; resumed Fred, &ldquo;that this
man Rufus wrote them both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s almost as good a letter writer as he is a
dresser, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; laughed Grant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just wait until I&rsquo;m done,&rdquo; retorted Fred.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s always the trouble in this party. Whenever
I start in to give you information and try to
teach you some things you need to know and don&rsquo;t
know, there&rsquo;s always somebody that has to spoil
it all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not spoiling it,&rdquo; laughed George. &ldquo;Go
ahead with your story. What makes you think he
wrote those letters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, me child,&rdquo; said Fred, &ldquo;and I will enlighten
thee. We suspect Rufus wrote them because
he talked almost all the way from Sault St.
Marie to Cockburn Island. Even when we stopped
on the shore of Mud Lake and he cooked our dinner
for us he kept on talking just the same whether we
were there or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the trouble with you, Fred,&rdquo; retorted
George. &ldquo;You say he kept on talking
whether you were there or not. Now how do you
know he kept on talking when you weren&rsquo;t there?
You see that&rsquo;s the reason we have to put in intelligent
questions sometimes. You are just as likely
to talk about things you don&rsquo;t know as you are
about things that you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; retorted Fred. &ldquo;This man in
the course of his extended remarks dropped a few
words that made us think he knew more than at
first we thought he did. We suspect that he runs
a motor-boat for this man over on Cockburn
Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the reason why he took you there?&rdquo;
inquired George.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; answered Fred. &ldquo;At any rate he
told us that he had to go that way and that he
had to be there this afternoon. I tell you, fellows,
that man is doing something he doesn&rsquo;t want Uncle
Sam to find out and my own impression is that he&rsquo;s
a smuggler and carrying on a regular trade at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think he smuggles?&rdquo; inquired
George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not just sure yet about that, but I&rsquo;m pretty
sure that I know where he hides the stuff before he
takes it over to Mackinac or up to Sault St. Marie.
In fact I think he has two places, one on Cockburn
Island and the other down on Western Duck
Island and I think, too, that he has a man or two on
each island. Rufus runs a boat between Cockburn
Island and Sault St. Marie and we suspect that he
has another man down on Western Duck who gets
rid of things there for him. And the strangest
part of all is where he hides the stuff on Cockburn
Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is that?&rdquo; demanded George and Grant,
who now were greatly interested in the story of
their friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he hides it in the barn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that old barn right behind his
shanty?&rdquo; inquired Grant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think he hides the stuff
there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;From what Rufus said. You see, Rufus isn&rsquo;t
more than half or three quarters witted, and he
feels that he hasn&rsquo;t been treated by this man as he
ought to have been. So he wrote those letters to
get even, as he said, with the smuggler, and then as
nothing was done about them he felt just as much
provoked at Mr. Button as he had at the smuggler
himself. So he has been first on one side and then
on the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose side is he on now?&rdquo; asked Grant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just at the present time he&rsquo;s on the smuggler&rsquo;s
side. But he was so anxious to talk all the while
that we think he let out more than he knew.
Among other things he told us why the smuggler
keeps that big dog that we saw the other night. It
seems there are three of those dogs and at night
two of them guard the barn and the other is taken
inside the house to protect that place. When we
asked Rufus why they had to have two dogs
around the barn he said that if we knew what was
in the barn we wouldn&rsquo;t ask any such foolish questions
as that. Putting that together with some
other things he said, I haven&rsquo;t any doubt that whatever
it is that Mr. Halsey deals in it is something
that is very valuable and isn&rsquo;t very large and can
be easily carried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose it is?&rdquo; inquired Grant.
&ldquo;That sounds like money.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Men don&rsquo;t smuggle money,&rdquo; sniffed Fred
scornfully. &ldquo;When we get back to Mackinac I&rsquo;m
going to tell Mr. Button, if he&rsquo;s there, all about it
and ask him what he thinks. And if he goes over
to Cockburn Island and makes a search I want to
go with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he can&rsquo;t make a search on Cockburn
Island,&rdquo; said George positively. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s in
Canada. An American officer can&rsquo;t go over there
and make searches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless he gets a Canadian officer to go with
him,&rdquo; retorted Fred. &ldquo;At all events when we get
back to Mackinac we&rsquo;ll find out what can be done
and then we&rsquo;ll just go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><span class="small">TWO BOATS</span></h2>
<p>It was late when the party at last arrived at
Mackinac Island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s twenty-five minutes past two,&rdquo; said
Grant sleepily as he looked at his watch after the
party had landed at the dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had so much excitement and so many
things to do in the last two or three days that I
think I shall sleep right through the bed,&rdquo; said
John.</p>
<p>The weary boys almost threatened to fulfill the
prophecy of John. In spite of the excitement
through which they had passed they were speedily
asleep and it was late the following morning before
any one arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up to-day?&rdquo; called Fred as he opened
the door between the rooms which the four boys
occupied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very much,&rdquo; responded George, who was
already dressed and had been down in the office of
the hotel. &ldquo;I have learned one thing though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you,&rdquo; laughed Grant. &ldquo;You
couldn&rsquo;t learn many less, that&rsquo;s one thing sure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have learned that Mr. Button has gone,&rdquo; declared
George, ignoring the bantering of his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone?&rdquo; demanded Grant. &ldquo;What do you
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean he has left Mackinac Island for
good and all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that. I simply said he had gone.
He is expected back here at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; called John, who now entered
the room and joined in the conversation.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad he isn&rsquo;t here. It will give us a chance
to rest up. It&rsquo;s ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning now,
but I feel as if I was almost ready to crawl back
into bed again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll feel all right by night,&rdquo; said Fred lightly.
&ldquo;I suggest that we sit around the hotel and not
try to do anything very strenuous to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The suggestion was followed by all four boys
and save for a walk about the Island they passed
the hours reading or writing letters.</p>
<p>Darkness had fallen before Mr. Button was seen
by any of the four boys. Approaching him, Fred
said, &ldquo;We have got another letter for you, Mr.
Button. It will match the one that came to me
that was intended for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Button glanced keenly at the boy as he spoke
and said, &ldquo;Is the letter intended for me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; said Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get it? Did it come to you
through the mail as the other one did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, we picked it up on the shore of Western
Duck Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Button more strongly
moved by the statement than the boys ever had
seen him before. &ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in my pocket,&rdquo; replied Fred. &ldquo;We wish
you would come up to our room, Mr. Button.
We&rsquo;ll give you the letter and tell you some other
things we have found out besides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accepting the invitation Mr. Button accompanied
the boys to the room which Fred and John
occupied and after he had seated himself in the
chair which was offered him by John, Fred at once
began his story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found this letter, Mr. Button, as I told you.
It must have dropped out of the pocket of that man
on the island or else Mr. Halsey lost it. At any
rate we thought it belonged either to me or to you
and I guess there&rsquo;s no question now that it is
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred handed the letter to their visitor, who at
once read it through and laughing lightly thrust it
into his pocket. &ldquo;It matches the other one,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and sounds very much as if they both were
written by the same man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have found the man that wrote them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have you?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Button quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. When John and I were taken by
that boat which rescued us we couldn&rsquo;t land until
we came to Sault St. Marie. It was almost morning
and we had a great time, as our clothes were
wet and we left them on the boat after we had put
on some duds the sailors gave us. We found we
didn&rsquo;t have any money when we went up town
and tried to get some breakfast, and when we went
back to the dock we were horrified to find that the
boat had gone on without us. Her next stop probably
is Duluth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she took your clothes with her?&rdquo; inquired
Mr. Button, smiling as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did that,&rdquo; declared Fred ruefully, &ldquo;and
that wasn&rsquo;t all of it either, for in our pockets were
all the valuable things we possessed, though I guess
money wasn&rsquo;t among them. By and by we found
a strange man there who agreed to bring us back
to Mackinac in his motor-boat if we would go with
him around by Cockburn Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he a red-haired man with big splotches of
red on his face? Was he tall and ungainly and
did he have a voice that no one could ever forget if
he once heard it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very man. He talked almost all
the way to Cockburn Island. He can do one thing
well though, let me tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He knows how to cook salt pork and potatoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy,&rdquo; said Mr. Button, &ldquo;that the air and
the appetites of you boys helped you to appreciate
the quality of Rufus&rsquo;s cooking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it did, but the strange part of it all was
after we stopped at Cockburn Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he wanted us to stay on board the boat
while he went up to that old house. He didn&rsquo;t
find what he wanted and when he came back he
said we would have to wait there for a while. It
was almost dark then. It seems he thinks he
hasn&rsquo;t been treated just right by this man Halsey,
who is probably the smuggler you want to get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Button smiled, but did not interrupt the
story which Fred was telling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While we were waiting, Rufus got to talking
about his experiences and he made us think that
he was the one that wrote both those letters. He
wanted to get even with the man who didn&rsquo;t give
him his share, as he believed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all he told you?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Button.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s another thing he spoke about and
that is the barn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Mr. Button quickly. &ldquo;What did
he say about the barn?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t so much what he said as what he
made us believe. He told about two Great Danes
they have to guard the barn and another one which
they have to protect the house. He said if anybody
tried to get into the barn they would have
their troubles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we asked him what any one would want
to go into that old tumbled down barn for and he
looked at us in a way that made us sure there was
something there worth while. Do you suppose
that Mr. Halsey hides in the barn the stuff which
he smuggles into the United States?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure&mdash;yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to find out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the things that brought me to
Mackinac Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the boys say,&rdquo; suggested Fred, &ldquo;that you
haven&rsquo;t any right to search his property over
there. He&rsquo;s in Canada and you belong to the
United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I surely do,&rdquo; responded Mr. Button smilingly,
&ldquo;but it is possible that I may try to make a few investigations,
not as an officer, but simply to satisfy
my personal curiosity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; inquired Fred impulsively.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>Mr. Button laughed again and after a brief silence
said, &ldquo;Why not? Perhaps I can make use
of your help. I don&rsquo;t mind telling you, now that
you know so much, that I expect to go over to
Cockburn Island to-morrow. Furthermore I expect
to make some investigations there. It may
be that I might take two of you boys with me,
though they used to tell me when I was a youngster
that one boy is a boy and two boys is a half a
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which two will you take?&rdquo; demanded Fred excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no preference. In fact I may be wrong
in allowing any of you to go. If either of those
huge dogs should attack you there would surely be
trouble. Besides, the little Japanese cannot be
ignored. And then too, the smuggler himself, if
he is caught on the ground, or finds we are making
our own investigations, may make more trouble
than all the rest put together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the reason,&rdquo; spoke up George excitedly,
&ldquo;that Grant and I can&rsquo;t take another motor-boat
and go over there near the channel and
spend the day fishing? You see we would be
within easy calling if you need us and the fact that
we were there might help to explain why Fred and
John were on the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There wouldn&rsquo;t be very much for you to do,&rdquo;
suggested Mr. Button.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be enough for us if we can just go
ahead,&rdquo; said Grant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>So eager were the boys and so intense was their
desire to join in the expedition of the morrow that
at last Mr. Button somewhat reluctantly gave his
consent, explaining that if there should be any real
danger he would insist upon the boys at once withdrawing
in their motor-boats across the American
border.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must start to-morrow morning,&rdquo; explained
Mr. Button, &ldquo;by four o&rsquo;clock at the
latest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be ready,&rdquo; declared Fred confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, all of you boys better turn in now,&rdquo; said
Mr. Button as he arose and departed from the
room.</p>
<p>True to their promise all four boys were on the
dock before four o&rsquo;clock the following morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we are going to have a good day,&rdquo; said
Mr. Button to Fred and John as soon as their motor-boat
was free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks so,&rdquo; said John as he glanced toward
the eastern sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean the weather alone,&rdquo; explained
Mr. Button, &ldquo;but I feel quite sure that Halsey will
not be on Cockburn Island to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know? What makes you think
so?&rdquo; demanded Fred quickly.</p>
<p>Mr. Button smiled, but did not explain his reasons
for the opinion which he held. Indeed, conversation
lagged and every one in the motor-boat
apparently was busy with his own thoughts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>The boat which George and Grant had secured
manifestly was much slower, for it soon was left
behind and had not been seen again when about
ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning the party drew near
the shores of Cockburn Island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing,&rdquo; explained Mr. Button, &ldquo;I
want you to do is to stay on board this motor-boat
while I go up to the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you may need us,&rdquo; suggested John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I do I shall let you know,&rdquo; laughed Mr. Button.</p>
<p>As soon as the boat came to anchor, taking the
little skiff which the motor-boat had in tow, Mr.
Button alone rowed quickly to the shore and soon
was on his way toward the little house in the distance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV
<br /><span class="small">A SMALL BOX</span></h2>
<p>The feeling of keen excitement, soon after
the departure of Mr. Button returned in
full force to the waiting boys. And what
a sharp contrast it presented to the scene all about
them! The waters of the lake were so smooth
that an occasional gentle breeze ruffled the surface
only in spots. There was scarcely a cloud to be
seen in the summer sky. The shadows of the
rocks and trees along the shore were so clearly reflected
in the lake that the boys were reminded of
the clearness of the water along the shores of
Mackinac Island. Far away the motor-boat in
which George and Grant were approaching now
could be seen. Whenever the two boys looked toward
the house in the distance they were again impressed
by the almost unnatural quietness of the
summer day. Not a person was to be seen near
the building and the silence was broken only by the
noisy flying grasshoppers near the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose this is all a false alarm,&rdquo; suggested
John at last breaking in upon the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I mean suppose that there&rsquo;s nothing in
this. Suppose the whole thing is a wild goose
chase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that Mr. Button may not be what
he says he is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know that I mean that,&rdquo; rejoined
John, &ldquo;but somehow it seems so unreal. It
doesn&rsquo;t seem possible that men really should be
trying to break the laws and smuggle goods across
the border here when everything is so quiet and
peaceful on every side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look yonder!&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed Fred,
pointing as he spoke to a man who could be
seen walking rapidly toward the shore. He was
coming from the house and it was quickly manifest
that it was Mr. Button himself who was returning.
He was alone and as the boys watched his rapid
approach their feeling of excitement quickly returned.</p>
<p>As soon as Mr. Button arrived it was manifest
to both Fred and John that he too had been
strongly aroused. His eyes were shining and
though his manner was quiet it was plain that he
was highly elated over some discovery he had
made.</p>
<p>As soon as he was on board the motor-boat he
said, &ldquo;The little Jap has taken two of the dogs and
gone away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone for good?&rdquo; demanded John.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. The woman says he has gone out to exercise
them and that he is usually gone an hour at
least. Now is the time when you boys can help me
if you really want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do,&rdquo; said Fred eagerly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go ahead
the minute you say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very good. What I want you to do is
just this,&mdash;while these dogs are away I&rsquo;ll go into
the house and keep the attention of the woman
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the third dog?&rdquo; demanded Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can manage that, too. Now, while
I&rsquo;m in the house I want you somehow to get into
the barn. There&rsquo;s a small box about six inches
square. It is a wooden box, not very heavy and
hidden somewhere in that place. I am sure your
eyes are keener than mine and you&rsquo;ll be more likely
to find it. If you get that box, almost all the difficulties
will be cleared away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in the box?&rdquo; inquired Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not need to know that now. Perhaps
I&rsquo;ll tell you later. I haven&rsquo;t any idea where the
box is hidden, but I am sure it is somewhere in that
little barn. You won&rsquo;t have very long for your
search. I might say too that even if you do not
find the box, if you come across anything that is
suspicious or that might contain valuables, I wish
you would bring it away with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we look under the floor?&rdquo; inquired Fred
quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, look under the floor. Anywhere and
everywhere. Work as fast as you are able, but
don&rsquo;t forget that in about an hour the Jap will
come back with those two Great Danes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want us to go straight to the barn!&rdquo;
inquired Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I think it will be better for you first to go
up the shore about a mile. Then you can land and
I don&rsquo;t think you will be so likely to be seen from
the house on your way to the barn. You will be
pretty well behind it anyway. As I told you, I&rsquo;ll
try to keep the woman busy and I do not think that
will be a very hard task.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she know you?&rdquo; asked John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in a way. She has seen me several times
and she is jealous. She thinks I am in the same
business that her husband is working in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean smuggling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smuggling what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you find that box I will tell you more about
it. Now, one of you boys take the skiff and land
me and then take the skiff with you while you go
farther down the shore in the motor-boat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>The directions of Mr. Button were speedily followed.
About a mile distant the boys discovered
a curving, sandy shore near which the motor-boat
was anchored. Taking the skiff, the boys speedily
landed and then in high excitement, all the time
watchful of the house in the distance, they ran
swiftly toward the barn. A few trees and great
rocks were found in the intervening distance and
twice the boys stopped and concealed themselves
while they tried to make sure that their presence
as yet had not been discovered.</p>
<p>In this way they rapidly advanced and soon the
two hundred yards which they were to cover had
been left behind them and both now were standing
at the rear door of the barn.</p>
<p>They were keenly disappointed when they discovered
that this door was locked or at least fastened
from within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; whispered John quickly.
Before he replied Fred turned and looked keenly
all about him. He was as fearful as his friend of
the return of the Japanese with the two huge dogs.
&ldquo;Maybe there&rsquo;s some other way of getting in,&rdquo; he
answered at last, and a moment later he announced
the discovery of a slide in the side of the barn.</p>
<p>Quickly the slide responded to his efforts and
was pulled back. Then hastily John lifted Fred
and in a moment the active lad was inside the barn.</p>
<p>In accordance with Fred&rsquo;s suggestion John remained
outside. In spite of his height it was difficult
for him to enter the barn as he had assisted his
friend to do. &ldquo;Let me know what you find,&rdquo; he
whispered as Fred disappeared from sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>Silence followed the suggestion, but John was
easily able to understand how busy Fred at once
became. The barn itself was small, covering not
more than thirty feet square. On the ground
floor, Fred discovered a small cart, two cramped
stalls and an open piano box, which also stood on
the floor. Apparently nothing alive was in the
little building. In one corner stood a ladder which
led to an opening in the loft above.</p>
<p>Quickly deciding to begin his search at the top
Fred ascended the ladder. He discovered only a
little hay on the floor above and with a pitch-fork,
which was conveniently near, he hastily began to
scatter it. There was nothing, however, to indicate
that the musty hay had recently been disturbed
and when a few minutes had elapsed Fred
was convinced that nothing had been concealed
in the loft.</p>
<p>Retracing his way to the floor below he was astonished
to behold his friend already busily engaged
in the search.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get in, Jack?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crawled in, the same as you did. Only I
didn&rsquo;t have any one to give me a boost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t need any boost with those long legs
of yours,&rdquo; responded Fred. &ldquo;Sometimes I think
it wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad if more of us were built on
your plan. Makes me think of a hickory nut stuck
on two knitting needles.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop for complimentary remarks,&rdquo; retorted
John good-naturedly. &ldquo;What we want is to
find that little box. You begin on one side and
I&rsquo;ll go on the other and we&rsquo;ll examine the four
sides to see if there are any more sliding panels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hasty inspection, however, failed to reveal any
concealed shelves. Next the boys inspected the
floor. Several of the boards were loose, but the
search was still unrewarded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going up the ladder,&rdquo; suggested John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been up there,&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t
anything up there. I know there isn&rsquo;t. There
isn&rsquo;t much hay and what there is is old and musty.
I turned it all over with the pitch-fork. It&rsquo;s like
looking for a needle in a haystack,&rdquo; he added
somewhat disconsolately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make any difference,&rdquo; said John.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going ahead with our search. I think Mr.
Button knew what he was talking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diligently the boys continued their efforts, working
rapidly and doing their utmost to discover the
small box which Mr. Button had described, or find
a place where it might be concealed.</p>
<p>All their efforts in the stalls, however, were as
unavailing as had been those in the other parts of
the barn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; said Fred, as the boys stopped for
a moment, &ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t any such thing here. It&rsquo;s
what I tell you, like looking for a needle in a haystack.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to give up you can sit down here
and wait for me,&rdquo; said John resolutely; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to keep this thing up until I strike oil or gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both boys earnestly renewed their search, but
their efforts in the rapidly passing minutes were
still unrewarded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t anything here,&rdquo; muttered Fred.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve looked high and low. Mr. Button didn&rsquo;t
know what he was talking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John made no response to the declaration of his
discouraged companion and perhaps abashed
somewhat by the zeal of John, again joined in the
search.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you looked in that piano-box?&rdquo; inquired
John at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but there isn&rsquo;t anything but a little meal
in the bottom. It isn&rsquo;t deep enough to cover a box
of matches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll look again anyway,&rdquo; said John as he
lifted the cover and glanced within the high box.
He was about to drop the cover when once more he
hesitated. Leaning over the edge he thrust his
long arms down into the meal below him. In one
corner of the box his fingers came in contact with
an object which instantly aroused his keenest interest.
A moment later he brought out a small
wooden box, discolored, heavy and apparently of
no value. He speedily discovered, however, that
the top of the box was fastened by a small and
strong pad-lock. Holding his discovery aloft
John quickly turned to Fred and said, &ldquo;Do you see
what I&rsquo;ve found?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is it? What is it?&rdquo; whispered Fred as
he ran to join his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I see, but how much does that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how much it means,&rdquo; retorted
John, &ldquo;but I do know that it is a wooden box, that
it&rsquo;s about six inches square and that it is heavy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to look at it,&rdquo; broke in Fred; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s old
and looks as if it had been left out in the weather.
Even if it is locked I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s anything
of any value in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t what troubles me,&rdquo; said John
quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I mean this box is hidden here. I don&rsquo;t
know as we have any right to take it. I wonder
too if Mr. Button is really what he says he is.
Suppose we take this box away with us and then
somebody arrests us for stealing? What&rsquo;s to
hinder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing to hinder,&rdquo; said Fred, &ldquo;but
we&rsquo;ll take the box with us just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each of the boys was confident whenever his
companion became fearful or discouraged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll say no more about it,&rdquo; said John
as his turned toward the open slide by which they
had entered the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t show it to Mr. Button when that woman
in there can see you,&rdquo; suggested Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; laughed John. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to heed
your advice, kind sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abruptly, however, both boys halted and neither
made any effort to depart while they both were
listening intently to sounds which they heard outside
the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull back the slide! Pull back the slide!&rdquo;
whispered Fred, now plainly alarmed. &ldquo;The Jap
is coming and he&rsquo;s got those two big dogs with him,
too. I don&rsquo;t know what will happen to us now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI
<br /><span class="small">CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Did he see you?&rdquo; inquired John, who was
now as keenly excited as his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. The only thing we
can do is to wait and see what happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The slide had been left open an inch or more and
through the open space both boys in their excitement
watched the little Japanese as he drew near.
The Great Danes were romping about the place
evidently enjoying their freedom. They were still
free when the Japanese turned and entered the
house. When he had closed the door behind him
the three dogs, for now the one that had not accompanied
the Japanese joined his mates, ran
about the place as full of life and kindness in their
somewhat awkward activities as a clumsy puppy.</p>
<p>Relieved that the Japanese had not come at once
to the barn the two boys were still anxious, for they
were aware that Mr. Button was yet in the house.
Indeed, as the time slowly passed, the excitement
of the boys steadily increased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There comes Rufus,&rdquo; whispered John at last.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for us to leave,&rdquo; said Fred, after
he had convinced himself that the peculiar helper
of Mr. Halsey was indeed coming to the barn.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for us to go above.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly Fred ran to the low ladder and swiftly
made his way to the loft, an example which John
speedily followed. John still held the box which
he had discovered in the meal and when both boys
had found a hiding place in the loft they peered
through a knot hole in the floor and watched Rufus
as he seated himself in the little cart.</p>
<p>The interest of the boys became still more intense
when after a few minutes had passed Mr.
Halsey himself came into the barn and closed the
door after he had entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right on time to-day, Rufus,&rdquo; said Mr.
Halsey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be I?&rdquo; replied Rufus, apparently not strongly
elated by the compliment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are, and I&rsquo;m going to give you that
box to take to Mackinac.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else are you going to give me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get all you deserve, Rufus, if you&rsquo;ll do
just what I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve heard you say before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you hear me say it now,&rdquo; said Mr.
Halsey sternly. &ldquo;You do your part and you need
not fear that I shall not do mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it you want me to do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have told you. I want you to take your motor-boat
and carry that little box to Mackinac.
You mustn&rsquo;t let anybody see it, for it is valuable
and much of what you will get from me depends
upon how successful you are in keeping everybody
away from that box, and delivering it safely just
where I tell you. I&rsquo;m writing out the directions,&rdquo;
he added, as drawing a blank card from his pocket
he hastily wrote upon the back and then handed it
to the ungainly man who apparently was still not
strongly impressed by the words he had heard.</p>
<p>As soon as this had been done Mr. Halsey advanced
to the piano box and lifting the cover
thrust his hand into the meal.</p>
<p>The boys were unable to see the expression
which came over his face, but in their imagination
they were both confident they knew how
startling his appearance was. They were still
able to see Rufus in his seat in the cart and the
alarm which he quickly manifested was connected
directly with the failure of his employer
to find the object for which he was seeking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that box?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Halsey,
turning and approaching the cart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know nothing about the box,&rdquo; grumbled
Rufus. &ldquo;All I do is take your boxes over
to Mackinac or down to Western Duck Island.
You promised to give me ten dollars a day and
I&rsquo;ve spent ten days for you this summer and you
have paid me just twelve dollars and a half.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll find this box for me I will give you
fifty dollars,&rdquo; declared Mr. Halsey. His excitement
was plainly manifest in his voice and
John trembled slightly as he assured himself
that the box he had found was still safely in his
possession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rufus,&rdquo; said Mr. Halsey sharply, &ldquo;have
you got that box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know where it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what is in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something good, I suppose, but I don&rsquo;t
know what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rufus,&rdquo; said Mr. Halsey again after a brief
silence, &ldquo;I want you to give up that box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I ain&rsquo;t got your box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You give me that box or I shall set the dogs
on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly the smuggler ran to the door to
carry out his threat. He whistled shrilly and
in response to his call the three huge dogs came
bounding into the barn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you one more chance,&rdquo; said Mr.
Halsey turning again to Rufus. &ldquo;You give me
that box or get it and I&rsquo;ll give you fifty dollars.
If you don&rsquo;t do it, then we&rsquo;ll see what you can
do against the dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know nothing about your box,&rdquo;
whined Rufus. It was plain now that he was
alarmed, but no one knew better than the waiting
boys how truthful his statement was.</p>
<p>And then an almost unaccountable event followed.
Angered by the persistent refusal of
Rufus, Mr. Halsey turned sharply and said to
the dogs, &ldquo;Bite him! Bite him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wild yell from Rufus followed when the
three huge dogs at once leaped upon him. They
were, however, possessed with the spirit of play
and not one of them did the trembling man any
harm. In his terror Rufus had slipped from his
seat and when he tried to leap to the floor he fell
in a heap. A series of wild yells followed when
the Great Danes came sniffing about him, apparently
puzzled by all the commotion.</p>
<p>Nor did they respond to the repeated demands
of Mr. Halsey to attack the prostrate man.</p>
<p>The screams of Rufus, however, had been heard
in the house and now Mr. Button and the Japanese
were seen running swiftly toward the barn. At
the same time the excitement of the dogs increased
and there were loud barkings and yelpings as they
ran and leaped about the place.</p>
<p>The little Japanese, however, as soon as he entered
the barn threw back his head and emitted
another of his wild, hoarse laughs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the joke?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Halsey angrily
as he turned upon his servant.</p>
<p>Again the Japanese laughed, and ignoring the
question called to the dogs, every one of which instantly
obeyed his call. Both Fred and John were
convinced that if the Japanese should order the
dogs to attack any one his word instantly would
be obeyed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the manner of Rufus again quickly
changed. Assured that he was safe from an attack,
the look of cunning again appeared in his little
red eyes and when the three men departed from
the barn there was a swagger in his walk as he led
the way to the house.</p>
<p>As soon as the boys were convinced that the men
had withdrawn, they quickly descended the ladder
and ran out into the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look yonder,&rdquo; said John grasping his friend
by the arm and pointing toward the shore.
&ldquo;There are George and Grant and they are both
coming here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more the merrier,&rdquo; laughed Fred, relieved
by the sight of his friends. &ldquo;There will be less
danger now than there was before. That man
Halsey is desperate. What have you done with
the box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have got it here under my sweater,&rdquo; answered
John in a low voice. &ldquo;Does it show?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not much. I don&rsquo;t believe I should notice it
unless I was looking for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment Mr. Button appeared in the
doorway of the kitchen and said, &ldquo;Come into the
house, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Mr. Button,&rdquo; called John.
&ldquo;Come out here a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man glanced hastily behind him and then
turned quickly around the corner of the house.
John at once joined him and in a low voice said,
&ldquo;We got the box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; whispered Mr. Button.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under my sweater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Standing directly in the way so that no one coming
from the house could see him, Mr. Button
glanced quickly at the box and then said, &ldquo;Keep
it, John, and don&rsquo;t let any one see it and guard it
as if your life depended upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the box you were looking for?&rdquo; whispered
John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Now we&rsquo;ll go into the house, or at least
I shall. Perhaps you had better stay here with
Fred until I call you or come out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George and Grant now had arrived, and laughingly
the former said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with
you fellows? You&rsquo;re all covered with dust and
dirt.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you would be if you had been where we
have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>John was unable to explain, however, for at that
moment both Mr. Button and Mr. Halsey together
came out of the house. The appearance of the latter
indicated that he was not so much angry as
crestfallen and perhaps alarmed as well. Mr.
Button, however, was quiet in his manner and as
he glanced at the boys his confidence and pride
were instantly manifest.</p>
<p>Rufus too came and joined the group and whispering
to Fred said, &ldquo;I want to go with you when
you leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Rufus?&rdquo; laughed Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to stay here after you go.
There&rsquo;s something happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll back you up, Rufus. I know you
didn&rsquo;t take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the jaw of the ungainly man
dropped and he stared blankly at the boy. &ldquo;What
do you know about it?&rdquo; he said at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very much,&rdquo; laughed Fred. &ldquo;If you want
to go with us I&rsquo;ll see if Mr. Button is willing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>The consent was readily obtained and in a brief
time the party which now consisted of six started
toward the shore where their motor-boats were
waiting for their coming.</p>
<p>It was not long before all were on board, Rufus
insisting upon taking his place with Fred and
John. It was on the same boat also that Mr. Button
sailed.</p>
<p>For a time, until the shores of Cockburn Island
could no longer be seen, silence rested upon the
party. No one appeared about the house as they
looked back at the island from which they had
come. Not even the dogs now could be seen.</p>
<p>It was then that Mr. Button turning to the boys
said, &ldquo;I fancy you boys are anxious to know what
all this means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we are,&rdquo; said Fred quickly. &ldquo;We know
a little, but not very much about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man,&rdquo; explained Mr. Button, &ldquo;is one of
the most expert smugglers of diamonds in America.
Sometimes he comes to New York, sometimes
to Boston and then again he lands at New
Orleans or Baltimore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why hasn&rsquo;t he ever been caught?&rdquo; inquired
John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was caught once and brought to trial, but
on some technicality he went free. I had word
that he was trying a new tack. Several times he
has landed at Montreal and then coming up the
river has made his way across the border hereabouts
and taken his goods either to Chicago or
Buffalo. But we have run the rascal down at
last.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t got him,&rdquo; protested Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. I couldn&rsquo;t take him on Canadian
soil without extradition papers. I have his diamonds,
however, and he prefers to give them up
rather than take any chances of being arrested and
handed over to our government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a strange way to smuggle,&rdquo; said John
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All smugglers are strange. I have been in the
employ of the government a good many years and
I never have found one that wasn&rsquo;t &lsquo;strange.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose those diamonds are
worth?&rdquo; inquired Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to the word we have received,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Button, &ldquo;there are diamonds in that
box valued at from $10,000 to $15,000.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;I guess I will hand it
over to you right away. You had better take it,&rdquo;
he said as he drew the box from its hiding place
and handed it to the Government Agent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to thank you boys for the part you have
taken,&rdquo; continued Mr. Button, &ldquo;and I shall not
forget about other rewards. I think the first real
evidence I had came when the clerk at the hotel
by mistake gave you my letter. Why did you
write those letters!&rdquo; he added turning abruptly
upon Rufus, as he spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What letters?&rdquo; demanded Rufus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the smuggler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the ungainly man appeared to
be somewhat confused; then, rising from his seat
and throwing back his shoulders, he said proudly,
&ldquo;I could not leave those diamonds on my conscience.
I had to tell you about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if that is the real reason. Did you
get all the pay that Mr. Halsey promised you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said Rufus, &ldquo;but I will have it pretty
soon. What are you laughing at!&rdquo; he demanded
abruptly as he turned toward the boys who were all
manifestly enjoying the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re laughing to think that Halsey gave up
his goods rather than take a chance of an arrest.
Of course he did not know that we had them. By
the way, Mr. Button, do you think it is right for
us to take them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right! Why not?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Button.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, they aren&rsquo;t ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true. They belong to the United
States, or will very soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you took them on Canadian soil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I take them?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Button smiling
as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we took them,&rdquo; acknowledged Fred.
&ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;ll get into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You need have no fear of that. They were
simply confiscated on one side of the line instead
of on the other and really this man Halsey has no
just claim to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This has been a great summer,&rdquo; said Fred enthusiastically.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been something stirring
every day. We have been going from one excitement
to another about as fast as we could go. But
now we have come to the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; laughed Mr. Button. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t
gotten to the end by any manner of means. Go
ahead boys never turn backward. I think you
will find that you have still more exciting experiences
before you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll go ahead and try them,&rdquo; laughed
John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not to-night,&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be in
Mackinac in a little while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make any difference,&rdquo; declared
John. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go ahead wherever we are.&rdquo;</p>

material from the Google Print project.)


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
